greycat	weapon_damage	Weapon damages are taken first from the table in objects.c (sdam,ldam => 1dS, 1dL).  But then special adjustments are made on a per-weapon, per-monster-size basis in weapon.c.  Ugh.
greycat	weapon_damage	Blessed weapons do +1d4 vs. demons and undead. Axes do +1d4 vs. wooden monsters.  Silver weapons do +1d20 vs. silver-hating monsters.  These special bonuses are divided by 2 for double-damage artifacts, so that they'll be doubled later on and get back to an approximation of their normal values.
greycat	weapon_damage	For specific categories, ask  about one of these: axe_damage blade_damage bludgeon_damage missile_damage polearm_damage spear_damage sword_damage tool_damage.  Note that these are categorized by the tables in the source code, not by strict weapon type.

dasunt	scroll_of_taming	When read by a confused player, an uncursed scroll of taming will try to tame monsters in an 11x11 circular area (and calm shopkeepers).  If cursed, it will anger monsters in an 11x11 circular area.
SpeedEvil	scroll_of_taming	"Natural" pets (horses, dogs, and cats) are initially tamed with a tameness of 10; other creatures start with a tameness of 5. This is important to note, for creatures that don't eat.
stumbly	scroll_of_taming	Scrolls of taming operate with an effective level of 9, as opposed to spells of charm monster which use actual player level.  d(100 + (level) - (monster level)) is compared to monster MR to determine success.
paxed	tombstone	Configuration option.  Draw a tombstone graphic upon your death.

greycat	fountain_gambit	A playing style in which you quaff from or #dip into fountains with your low-level character.  The potential reward of a wish is considered by some players enough to overcome the far-more-likely outcome of death by water moccasin or hostile water demon.  Since it's only a low-level character, if you die you didn't lose much; but if you get a wish, you gain enormously.
HiSPeed	fountain_gambit	Doing the fountain gambit with a wizard has a chance of surviving thanks to force bolt and continous level ups (including hp + pw increase).
rast	fountain_gambit	Other players dislike this practice and compare it to #quitting and restarting until a blessed magic lamp is generated in the first room.
rast	fountain_gambit	The expected value of 100 first-level fountains is two wishes, eight hostile water demons, ten groups of snakes, and ten nymphs.  Lower down in the dungeon you will get less wishes and more hostile water demons.

itsblah	loadstone	If you end up with one, you can uncurse it to drop it. Beware, as it recurses when you get rid of it!
SpeedEvil	loadstone	A slightly odder way to remove it is to zap yourself with stone-to-flesh. Remove all other stone items from inventory first.

dasunt	gloves	There are four types of gloves in the game:  leather gloves (yugake), gauntlets of dexterity, gauntlets of fumbling, and gauntlets of power.  Their unidentified descriptions are randomized per game:  old gloves, padded gloves, riding gloves, fencing gloves.
dasunt	gloves	To identify gloves, use these guidelines:  Leather gloves are common, tend to be dropped by certain NPCs, and cost far less then the other types.  Gauntlets of fumbling tend to be cursed, if they are not, wearing them should give a clue.  Gauntlets of power auto-identify when worn.  Which leaves gauntlets of dexterity as the last possibility - they will auto-identify if enchanted.
Zealot	gloves	Leather gloves cost 8 zorkmids; the others cost 50 zorkmids.
greycat	gloves	Gauntlets of power are metal, and will therefore rust and increase spell failure probabilities; the others are non-metallic.  For spellcasters, gauntlets of dexterity are the gloves of choice.
ihope	gloves	Gauntlets of power weigh 30; the others weigh 10.

itsblah	magic_resistance	Magicbane also provides magic resistance when wielded.
Zarel	magic_resistance	It's a bad idea to rely solely on your role's quest artifact for magic resistance, since it can be stolen by Rodney or your quest nemesis.

All other wands only write in the dust -- use your fingers instead.
greycat	skeleton	This white 'Z' monster can touch you to slow you down (removes your intrinsic speed).  Normally these only appear in Orcus's domain, but you know how polytraps and other effects can bring out the worst in some folks.
greycat	skeleton	The worst part of the skeleton's attack is that you aren't *told* that you've lost an intrinsic; you have to check for it by other means.
Sartak	sokoscumming	Say you really like amulets of reflection OR bags of holding. So much so that you quit if you get the wrong soko prize.

greycat	tsurugi_of_muramasa	A honkin' big sword that can bisect humanoid-sized monsters, or do extra damage vs. big ones, but which is quite silly for a two-weapon combat specialist like the Samurai (whose quest artifact this is).
greycat	tsurugi_of_muramasa	Exact damage is 1d16+d8 vs. small, 1d8+2d6+1d8 vs. large.  Each hit has a 5% chance of instantly killing small creatures (or ones engulfing you), or double damage vs. large ones.
greycat	tsurugi_of_muramasa	It also acts as a luckstone.
Azeral	tsurugi_of_muramasa	As is the case for Vorpal Blade, artifact weapons that are thrown upward are explicitly disallowed from rolling 1 (or 20) on the attack roll, so you cannot bisect yourself this way. Sorry.

lorimer	+2_or_+3	The short answer: It depends.  You have 60% chance of getting +3, and 80% chance of getting +2.
lorimer	+2_or_+3	If you are wishing for something where the special properties of the item itself are worth more than the + (silver or grey dragon scale mail, for example), then go with +3.
lorimer	+2_or_+3	If you are wishing for something where the + is the whole point of the thing (gauntlets of dexterity or a helm of brilliance), you should go with +2.

Cyde	ascension_kit	Must include some combination of GDSM, SDSM, amulet of reflection, shield of reflection, cloak of magic resistance, or a magic resistance granting quest artifact such that the player has both magic resistance and magic reflection.
greycat	ascension_kit	The bare minimum is: magic resistance, a unicorn horn, good AC and HP, some food, some way to eliminate monsters (weapons, spells, pets), and a way to uncurse your equipment.
Tsingi	ascension_kit	reading a blessed or uncursed scroll of gold detection while confused or reading a cursed scroll will identify traps on the level, including portals.  This is a good way to locate the portals on the elemental planes. If you want to do this for all levels you need four of them, plus any backups you think you might need.
Hellzon	ascension_kit	There's a thorough guide at http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Ascension_kit
Poeir	how_to_annoy_people_in_one_easy_step	A good way to annoy people in one easy step is to use the ?> to message the entire channel, mainly with large entries, particularly ones that don't go anywhere...
Poeir	how_to_annoy_people_in_one_easy_step	Like the time I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days.  So I tied an onion to my belt, as was the style at the time.  Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel and in those days nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them; "Give me five bees for a quarter!" you'd say.
KimmoKM	how_to_annoy_people_in_one_easy_step	Just behave like KimmoKM. This is the easiest way to annoy people.
billnye	how_to_annoy_people_in_one_easy_step	Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. The important thing was that I had an onion tied to my belt, as was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the war, all you could get was those big yellow ones...
Zarel	how_to_annoy_people_in_one_easy_step	It's even better if the definitions with the ?> command is large, like this one. Of course, this message certainly isn't to be used for such purposes, and was made longer for other reasons, like.... uh.... um..... well.... you see.... Oh, forget it.
Violist	how_to_annoy_people_in_one_easy_step	But the yellow ones stank so much, we had to put those clothespins over our noses when we went into town. 'course, that didn't help the eyes, but you were crying anyways because of all these people with clothespins on their noses. But I was laughing so hard I went right by the shoestore, which in the old days was called a footstore. We often called it Footsore because the boots were so awful.

dtype	woodchuck	An inordinately rare creature that can only be unnaturally created into existence. Its inclusion was somewhat of a joke, but it does provide headaches for extinctionists. Try wishing for a figurine of one to see it in real life.

scorchgeek	polyself	Polymorphing yourself is a somewhat rare but fairly useful tactic. To use polyself effectively, you need a source of polymorph (wand, ring, spell), and a ring of polymorph control. (You can gain control as an intrinsic by eating the ring, in some cases.)
scorchgeek	polyself	Good all-around choices (all of which can wield weapons and wear armor), include arch-lich (poor touch attack, but has regeneration and is strong), master mind flayer (eats brains for loads of damage), vampire lord (flies and has regeneration, and can drain levels), Aleax (gets two weapon attacks).
scorchgeek	polyself	Air elementals make you extremely fast, but are otherwise poor forms; titans are both fairly fast and good fighters, but destroy armor.
scorchgeek	polyself	Xorns can eat metal, allowing you to gain some ring properties as intrinsics; they can also phase through walls, making it a popular choice for finishing the rogue quest. Gelatinous cubes can eat wooden rings. Both will break armor.
scorchgeek	polyself	Female dragons can lay eggs, making it easy to gain new pets, and black dragons have a powerful disintegration breath (#monster), that instakills every monster in the game that it hits besides the Riders and black dragons. Note that dragons will break your armor.
scorchgeek	polyself	You can also polymorph yourself into your own race; this also happens 1/5 of the time even with polymorph control, and will change  your attributes randomly and cure a variety of ailments. Polymorphing into your own race does not break polyselfless conduct.
scorchgeek	polyself	If your hp drops below positive while in a polymorphed form, you will revert to your normal form. However, if you are wearing an amulet of unchanging you will die instead. Note that deaths other than losing HP will also still kill you.
scorchgeek	polyself	Attributes are saved when you polymorph, and return to their original values when you revert (except wisdom).
scorchgeek	polyself	See 'edible rings' for a list of edible rings.  See 'eating amulets' for information about eating amulets.

dtype	chameleon	Diff 7, Lvl 6. Eating one will polymorph you.

Eidolos	chameleon	You may like to tame chameleons while they are in an easily-tameable form (cat, dog, pony, etc.). In any event, a tame arch-lich would be better than a hostile arch-lich.
braindancer	chameleon	if a chameleon is in gremlin form and spawns new gremlins, those will be shapeshifters too.
scwizard	chameleon	If you get killed by a shapeshifter then the game will say you got killed by the shapeshifter's current form unless you're wearing a ring of protection from shape changers.

greycat	sokoban	This special dungeon branch is completely optional, but is a good source of food and a decent exercise regimen for under-muscled characters.  Once you learn the correct pattern for pushing the boulders around, it's not hard.  Beware that certain actions (breaking boulders, etc.) in Sokoban will impose a luck penalty.
Zealot	sokoban	A good Sokoban spoiler is located at http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/soko-331.html , if you're into that sort of thing.
Cyde	sokoban	There is no magical reset button.

mekkis	sokoban	In the sokoban branch, reading scrolls of earth, jumping, casting stone-to-flesh at a boulder, polymorphing a boulder, smashing a boulder, being pulled by a chain attached to a thrown iron ball, movement by Newton's Third Law and squeezing past a boulder will give a -1 penalty to luck.
iank	sokoban	http://iank.org/nhss/ is a 'practice environment' for sokoban, to avoid messing up irreversibly in the real game
teabing	sokoban	it has been estimated that roughly 1.9% of games will generate at least one wand of wishing in sokoban (and that's not even counting any randomly generated wands)

dasunt	t	Monster: 'T'  Trolls.  Not only do they bugger you in everyday life, usenet and IRC, they follow you into nethack!  Worst of all, they come back.  Again and again.  In addition to the plain 'troll', there are ice, rock and water trolls, and the Olog-hai.  Try eating the corpses, throwing them into water to drown ('cept water trolls), putting them into boxes, chests, or bags of holding, or stoning the monsters.

jilles	twoweapon	To begin two-weapon combat, wield your primary weapon and your non-artifact secondary weapon in the alternate slot, and #twoweapon. Use the exchange weapons command 'x' to put your wielded weapon into your alternate slot.

But they are fast, they can teleport and are able to steal your gold. So always have some means of either securing your cash or killing them quickly.
billnye	leprechaun	They can only teleport if they steal gold from you, or from the floor at your feet.  They can't teleport after stealing gold that's lying on the ground away from you.  So either drop your gold and *step away from it* or stash it away in a sack before fighting them.

mathx	drain_for_prot	Suggested that you notch up your bedposts with a number of nurse encounters BEFORE trying this, so you have a healthy, say, 80HP at level 1. Added bonus: leveling back up with your probably-18-Con-by-now character gets you even more max hp. You also get to fix all those silly skill slot choices you made 30k turns ago. Used by mathx, et al.
mathx	drain_for_prot	It gets boring #ch<cr><space>400<cr>'ing each time you donate, so make a macro. Wield a creampie or a !o*Heal tho incase your macro messes up when something happens, cuz this one time, I, uh...</wiggum>

jmr	alchemy	See also: http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/pot2-343.html
PsyMar	alchemy	Note that some of the seemingly "useless" alchemy formulas in the table, like speed+fruit juice = booze, are sometimes quite useful if their results are smoky in your game.  Also, while "sickness+fruit juice=sickness" seems useless, you could use it to turn 1 sickness and 10 fruit juice into 10 sickness, and if sickness is smoky... you get the idea.
PsyMar	alchemy	In rare cases, you may wish to alchemize for booze if you have reached the planes with no forgotten spells -- but don't bless the booze or it won't work.

tsuteiuQ	pudding_farming	A somewhat abusive technique for getting large amounts of items and corpses for sacrificing.
tsuteiuQ	pudding_farming	Step 1. Locate a level which has both a sink and an altar.
tsuteiuQ	pudding_farming	Step 2. Clear a sufficiently large area for your farm and light it up.
tsuteiuQ	pudding_farming	Step 3. Kick the sink to create a black pudding, then attack it with a dull knife to split it into many more puddings. Let them heal, and repeat the process.
tsuteiuQ	pudding_farming	Step 4. Lure the puddings toward your altar and kill them with the dull knife, allowing them to split even more.
tsuteiuQ	pudding_farming	Step 5. Profit! Sacrifice the corpses for artifacts/prayers and collect the items they leave behind, polypiling whatever you don't need.
tsuteiuQ	pudding_farming	If you can't find a sink, you can reverse-genocide black/brown puddings, bring a corpse from another level and revive it using a wand/spell of Turn Undead, or simply wait until one shows up.
TauPan	pudding_farming	You can also lure puddings down holes, if there's a sink above a usable altar.
paxed	pudding_farming	If you can't find a pudding, you can also polymorph yourself into one and wait for a monster wielding a metallic weapon to hit you.
Elliott	pudding_farming	See entry on Puddingbane
Elliott	pudding_farming	Brown puddings are nice because they don't hit for damage. Black puddings are nice because they always leave corpses (browns don't always), and your god likes them more.
Elliott	pudding_farming	You might want to consider zapping the starting pudding with a wand of speed monster; they'll move onto your altar faster.
Rapidfire	pudding_farming	Chaotics get 166% more prayer timeout reduction than other alignments, and are more efficient at pudding farming.

durron597	enchantment_spells	Skilled: Wizard. Basic: Monk, Tourist.
paxed	angband	Another roguelike.
paxed	angband	More easily extendable than NetHack, but doesn't have as many interesting interactions.
dasunt	angband	tends towards many fractured variants, such as ZAngb (Zelanzy-influenced), ToME (Tolkien-influenced), sCthAngband (Cthulhu) and Mangband (MultiPlayer), and over 20 others
greycat	angband	The official site is at http://www.thangorodrim.net/
ZeffriN	you_feel_rather_monster-ish	You would've polymorphed into monster, had it not been genocided.  Wisdom is exercised.
yeled	amber_flash	when you drop a blessed item on an altar, it flashes amber.
paxed	athame	A sacrificial dagger.  Does not get dull when used for engraving, unless it is cursed.  Master liches and arch-liches have a chance of carrying one.
jilles	athame	Engraving Elbereth with a non-cursed athame takes only one turn.
Stevie	athame	Master liches have a 6% chance (6/91), while arch liches have a 22% chance (2/9). Arch L athames also have a 25% chance of being fooproofed.
Stevie	athame	As an added bonus, Arch L athames have a 1/260 chance of being Magicbane :)
Cheapy	athame	Damage is 1d4/1d3. As a dagger it has +2 to-hit.
Grognor	silver_spear	Does d6 damage to small enemies and d8 damage to large enemies, and also does an extra d20 damage to silver haters.
Poeir	engrave_testing	A method of determining what a wand is by engraving some garbage text in the dust with your fingers, then engraving more with the wand to see any effects. Different wands have different messages when engraved with.
chlorine	engrave_testing	If you get the "The bugs on the floor stop moving!", the wand is sleep or death. "The bugs on the floor slow down!" means you have a wand of slow monster.
chlorine	engrave_testing	If you get the message "The engraving on the floor vanishes!", the wand is either make invisible, teleportation, or cancellation. You can further ID by zapping an item and a monster. If nothing appears to happen, it's canc. If both disappear, it's tele. Otherwise, the monster will disappear (or fade), so it's make invis.
nornagon	engrave_testing	A wand of cold will erase an existing burned-in engraving ("The engraving on the floor vanishes!"), then "A few ice cubes drop from the wand"
nornagon	engrave_testing	If the engraving changes substantially (it'll be obvious), then the wand is polymorph. "The bugs on the floor speed up!" means you have a wand of speed monster.
nornagon	engrave_testing	If the wand "unsuccessfully fights your attempt to write", that's a wand of striking you're packing. This is a pun on the word "striking". The message is used in the sense of "I'm going on strike." A wand of magic missile will make the floor "riddled by bullet holes!"
nornagon	engrave_testing	Engraving with a wand of wishing, light, enlightenment or create monster will auto-identify and have the same effect as zapping the wand.
nornagon	engrave_testing	If you get no message, See {e_nomsg} for your options
nornagon	engrave_testing	One can also tell if a gem is hard or soft by engraving with it. Be careful, engraving with a gem takes a long time - 1 letter per turn!
nornagon	engrave_testing	Hard gems are always valuable (good for throwing to unicorns), while soft gems can be either. Remember, shopkeepers won't pay you full price for unid'd gems, even if you know they're valuable!
Eidolos	engrave_testing	In the off chance you're playing illiterate, you can still engrave test -- but only engrave a single 'x' or 'X'.
Eidolos	engrave_testing	Wands of digging, fire, and lightning will autoid before you write with the wand. You'll probably want to write Elbereth, especially if the wand is fire or lightning.

greycat	feeling_of_inadequacy	"You have a feeling of inadequacy."  You're trying to mollify an angry god, but your sacrifices aren't big enough (monster level).  Try cross-aligned unicorns, too; unless you're chaotic. They won't help.

Stevie	cancelable_monsters	Nymphs (MR 30) become plain nymphs and cannot steal things.

Stevie	cancelable_monsters	All standard dragons (D, MR 20) lose their breath ability ("<monster> coughs").
Stevie	cancelable_monsters	Demons (most &, of varying MR) can't do their bring-in-some-friends routine once cancelled.
Stevie	cancelable_monsters	Similarly, werefoo can't summon help if you cancel them; additionally, they get stuck in whatever form they were in when cancelled.
Stevie	cancelable_monsters	Xans (red x) can't prick and injure your legs.
Stevie	cancelable_monsters	Green slimes (P, MR 0!) cannot slime you by touching you (although their corpses are just as deadly to eat).

Eidolos	edible_rings	Eating a ring has a 33% chance of conveying its intrinsic. (20% for eating an amulet) "Magic spreads through your body as you digest the ring|amulet."

Eidolos	menucolors	You can find the patch at http://bilious.homelinux.org/~paxed/nethack/nh343-menucolor.diff
CronoCloud	menucolors	Nethack on NAO currently uses GNU regex, not POSIX.
CronoCloud	menucolors	Many players on NAO use Eidolos's menucolors settings, and he encourages others to use them, that's why he has version numbers and dates.  http://alt.org/nethack/userdata/Eidolos/Eidolos.nh343rc

scwizard	fast	If you are already fast, getting hit by a skeleton or shade, eating a quantum mechanic corpse or getting hit with a wand of slow monster will make you lose your intrinsic speed

Using #twoweapon while riding always bestows a -2 to-hit penalty.

If you manage to get close enough to destroy the boulder (a pickaxe, /oStriking, or Force Bolt work), walk around to find the trap; the trap will disappear if triggered with no boulder.
umopepisdn	rolling_boulder_trap	You can also untrap them by pushing the boulder away.

Stevie[FP]	warhorse	To top it all off, they're herbivores, so they won't eat most corpses that grant intrinsics.
Stevie[FP]	warhorse	(The downside to this is, they tend to have very low tameness, so if you leave them stranded on another level, they become untame and usually end up hostile when you return.)
Zeffrin	warhorse	Eaten: warhorse   Nutr: 350

greycat	rubber_chicken	Slang term for cockatrice corpse.
lorimer	+3	see {+2_or_+3}
dasunt	stressed	A method of killing yourself by carrying too much and dropping your speed.  You will lose 1/2 of your speed.  Consider - you will not be able to outrun many monsters, monsters will tend to do 100% more damage (get two hits instead of one), and if you were very fast, odds are that you are now slower then a normal-speed character.
greycat	stressed	At level Stressed or higher, you cannot climb up stairs (but you can fall down them).
mathx	stressed	when carrying 1.5 to 2.0x capacity. -3 to hit. Extra hunger count on odd turns. Excercises Str. Can drown (like burdened or worse) by not getting a turn to climb out.

ekiM	pray_for_maxhp	When low HP is cured by prayer, not only are you restored to maximum HP, characters with low maximum HP (maxHP <= 5*(level+2)) will receive an additional 1d5 maximum HP at the end of the prayer. This can be useful for weedy characters in the early game to get their maximum HP up. Be careful though!
ekiM	pray_for_maxhp	For this to work, have your HP < = 5 (or < 1/7 max HP, rounded down), have prayer timeout of less than 200, have non-negative luck, unangry God, and have positive aligment. CPTVW start with 0 alignment so should whack a cross-aligned monster first. Everyone starts with 300 prayer timeout so wait until turn 102. Try throwing non-weapons in the air to get your HP down.

dasunt	dented_pot	An iron helmet that drops AC by one.  Use a dwarvish iron helm instead for a drop of AC by 2.
espritellipsis	unencumbered	A method of killing yourself by carrying too much and dropping your speed.  You lose 0/1 of your speed.  If this sounds reasonable, consider - you will not be able to outrun many monsters (especially those with intrinsic speed) and monsters will tend to do 0% more damage.
Poeir	you_hear_the_rumble_of_distant_thunder	Whoops!  You just killed your pet.  -15 to alignment, -1 to luck.

Mucknert	altar	Commonly used for #offering fresh corpses (usually not of your own race), #praying for certain favors, 'd'ropping items to get hold of their cursed/uncursed/blessed status. You can raise your luck with it, get non-quest artifacts, get crowned, obtain spellbooks and many many more with those, too.
Poeir	altar	#offer a corpse on an altar to raise your alignment.  If you sacrifice on a noncoaligned altar with positive alignment, there's a chance (yourLevel+2)/(yourLevel+8) you'll convert the altar to be coaligned, but if you have a negative alignment, there's a chance your alignment will change (making the game unwinnable if done before the Quest).
Poeir	altar	See http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/pray.html for complete praying spoiler.
Poeir	altar	Attempting to engrave on top of one is a good way to get a -1 luck penalty, or a -1 wisdom penalty if the altar is co-aligned.
zezozose	altar	Luck has no effect on your chances of converting an altar, but it will affect your chances of being confronted by a minion of the god of the altar you converted (or tried to).
zezozose	altar	If your alignment is negative when you try to convert an altar, you will be converted to the altar's god instead.
zezozose	altar	Failing to convert an altar incurs a -1 luck penalty.
zezozose	altar	Being converted to the altar's god incurs a -3 luck penalty.
l338	altar	Attempting to sit on an altar has the same effect as attempting to engrave.
AnMaster	altar	Kicking an altar is also a bad idea.
ekiM	altar	conversion chances (XL+2)/(XL+8). See http://klozoff.ms11.net/nethack-altar-conversion-chances.html

Zeffrin	archeologist	Eaten: archeologist   Nutr: 400   Effects: Human
paxed	gremlin	Little green g that multiplies in water.  Especially dangerous during night, as it has a high chance of stealing intrinsics when it hits (this is NOT blocked by magic cancellation). Their corpses are poisonous.
Poeir	gremlin	Level 5, difficulty 8, speed 12, AC 2, 25% magic resistance, deals 1d6 + 1d6 + 1d4 + steals intrinsic damage (if night).  This is the only way to lose aggravate monster.
Babamus	gremlin	It is night from 22:00 to 05:59.
Rapidfire	gremlin	These little buggers are chaotic, and thus (if randomly generated) will be peaceful to chaotics with positive alignment.
Rapidfire	gremlin	Therefore, they won't try to steal your intrinsics. Yet another reason to play Chaotic. :)
Zeffrin	gremlin	Eaten: gremlin   Nutr: 20   Effects: Poisonous     Intrinsic: Poison: 33%
blackcustard	gremlin	If an invisible gremlin splits, both new gremlins will be invisible. If a named gremlin splits, both new gremlins will share the name.
blackcustard	gremlin	Gremlins can use their intrinsic stealing ability on other monsters, producing the messages "The gremlin chuckles" and "You hear laughter" (if the gremlin was out of your sight). HOWEVER, the gremlin cannot actually steal an intrinsic from another monster.
blackcustard	gremlin	They can however destroy clay golems with that attack, producing the same messages. (If you are polymorphed into one, your clay golem form will be destroyed.)
blackcustard	gremlin	Gremlins are hurt by light, for instance from breaking a wand of light or applying an expensive camera.
Stevie-O	you_smell_charred_flesh	You stepped on a magic trap -- count your blessings, because nothing bad happened this time.
mathx	crazy_lines	You read magic mapping outside the map or or on a non mappable level (VotD, etc). Confused ?oMM maps 1/7th of the level..
ZeroOne	gradewrecker	Gradewrecker, aka NetHack. ;)
itsblah	energy_vortex	A vortex that engulfs you to deal a small (1d6+0) amount of electric damage. However, attacking it causes a powerful electric passive attack (similar to a blue jelly's cold passive attack). Attacking it in melee without shock resistance is NOT suggested.
billnye	energy_vortex	...This includes from inside it.  If you lack ranged weapons, throwing and picking up your main weapon repeatedly is advised.

Grognor	sprig_of_wolfsbane	see {wolfsbane}
paxed	oracle	The Oracle is located between levels 5 and 9 of the Dungeons of Doom.  #chat with her, and for a small sum of money she'll tell you things in her own cryptic way. This is mostly useful for unspoiled players.
Yui	oracle	a minor oracularity (from the true rumours file) is 50 zorkmids and gives you a few xp.
Yui	oracle	a major (specific, if highly cryptic, information) is 500 + (50*XL) and gives you a few more xp.
Violist	oracle	Her only attack is a (passive) shower of missiles, so you can easily take her out with MR.
HanClinto	oracle	If you request a consultation for which you don't have enough money, she will scornfully take all of your money and give you no help at all. Also, it will have used up your attempt to get experience for that kind of consultation.
Sembiance	oracle	You only get the experience bonus the first time for each type of consultation.
Zeffrin	oracle	Eaten: Oracle   Nutr: 400   Effects: Human
Eidolos	rogue_quest	There are separate compartments in the rogue quest. There's one with the <, the one with the Master Assassin, the one with the $ lake, and another one with no notable features. You may land in a compartment that has neither nemesis nor < so you'll need a reliable way to leave.
Eidolos	rogue_quest	Digging down into the final level works fine, that way you just need a way to leave. Levelporting or polymorphing into a xorn (to go into the compartment you want) are popular methods of defeating the quest.
Eidolos	rogue_quest	Note well, o Rogue! The master assassin will probably teleport to the < (which is in a different compartment!) when damaged, so be sure to take that into consideration. If you have a spare c!oGL, you may find it profitable to share it.
mekkis	magenta	The colour used to refer to the baddest monsters available.  If you see a magenta monster that isn't an F or an x, watch out...

paxed	showscore	Configuration option.  Show your approximate accumulated score on bottom line.
Asday	you_glimpse_a_four_leaf_clover_at_your_feet	Your luck was increased by sacrificing at an altar.  You may also safely pray again.
joshk	hopeful_feeling	See also {feeling of reconciliation}.
jilles	hopeful_feeling	Your sacrifice reduced the prayer timeout but not to zero; it is not necessarily safe to pray yet.
dtype	master_lich	Genocide L's when you can! Master Liches curse items in inventory, summon monsters, teleport to heal, and are otherwise a general nuisance. Quite possibly the most annoying (and dangerous) non-named creatures in the game.
jilles	master_lich	Arch-liches and high-level master liches can cast touch of death.
jilles	master_lich	They like waking up all monsters on the level ("You feel monsters are aware of your presence.")
SpeedEvil	master_lich	Arch and master liches (both represented as a purple 'L') have MR 90, which basically means they are highly resistant to many spells. 
Anden	master_lich	they can also summon Yeenoghu (and maybe other demon lords as well)
Calamarain	the_heat_and_smoke_are_gone	You just entered Vlad's tower. This is not a part of Gehennom, and thus you may pray here.
Stevie-O	riddled_by_bullet_holes	You have engraved with a wand of magic missile.
joshk	master_kaen	Master Kaen is the Monk quest nemesis. He's extremely tough, hits HARD, and you won't even see him once you reach his level until he starts whacking you.
jilles	master_kaen	To beat him "straight", have at least about 300 hp, good ac and a good weapon.
jilles	master_kaen	Levitating or walking over the lava may be useful.
jilles	master_kaen	Spells or wands of sleep may be effective, but they will often miss or Master Kaen will resist them (due to his -11 or -12 AC).
jilles	master_kaen	If you're not wearing body armor and have free action, hitting him with a potion of paralysis may be a good idea.
SpeedEvil	master_kaen	Drain life works surprisingly well. You need not stand on the stairs up for this spell to kill him. It's better to stand on the downstair so you can temporarily flee. Engrave Elbereth on the other side of the stairs so you can heal without molestation by xorns or earth elementals.
Eidolos	master_kaen	Rast recommends (and Eidolos approves of) using a scroll of earth in addition to the drain life technique.
Mumbo	master_kaen	Fireball and Cone of Cold also work wonders, but you'll need that boulder fort to prevent the spell from hitting you as well.
runcible	master_kaen	A boulder fort in his lair is the easiest/safest method; upon arrival in his level burn E, do something to wake him up (zapping a wand of light [can confirm this will always awaken him], tin whistle, possibly other wands), he will port over, read blessed or uncursed earth and next turn he will pop outside the fort.
runcible	master_kaen	This will expose you to at most one turn in melee distance.  Often he'll port over and drink a potion or other silliness.  From inside the fort you can use anything that doesn't need to go through MR to kill him (drain life, cold, fire, throwing rocks, etc).
scorchgeek	master_kaen	Another method is to polymorph yourself into a black dragon and #monster to disintegrate him. Contrary to popular belief, this will not destroy the Eyes of the Overworld.
Zeffrin	master_kaen	Eaten: Master Kaen   Nutr: 400   Effects: Human     Intrinsic: Poison: 100%

dasunt	pacifist	A method of playing where the player does not directly kill any creatures.
umopepisdn	pacifist	Usually aided by pets, and conflict.
umopepisdn	pacifist	An early wish for a blessed figurine of an archon will aid you greatly.
pmc	pacifist	make sure your pet's XP level is high enough to attack Rodney
umopepisdn	pacifist	Or use conflict for it.
Yui	pacifist	You can get some experience points by consulting with the Oracle, eating tripe, untrapping squeaky boards, and quaffing from sinks.
Diablo-D3	pacifist	PacifistRobin (password: robin) is a community game for playing with the pacifist conduct.
`Masque	pacifist	A better term for this method is "Politician", since you're not actually against the death of those who oppose you - you just have others take care of the messy parts for you.

dtype	nymph	These little vixens are not dangerous in melee, but are quick and will steal items from your inventory and teleport away. Never underestimate how helpless you are without your weapon and best armor. Kill them from range if possible, or simply avoid them, as they are usually asleep when you encounter them.
dtype	nymph	Eating nymph corpses can give you teleportitis.
Sebbe	nymph	Usually found carrying a potion of object detection and a mirror.
Mucknert	nymph	When polymorphed into one, heavy iron balls may be removed with #monster command.
itsblah	nymph	Monster nymphs can carry a practically unlimited amount of items; players polymorphed into a nymph get the maximum carrying capacity.
Nodey	nymph	Because they are often carrying a mirror, it is harmful to your luck to kill them with Force bolt or wands of striking.
scwizard	nymph	If you lack a ranged attack, a pet is a very effective way of dealing with them
Gaulgath	nymph	a nymph can be created by quaffing from a fountain (water) or ringing a cursed bell. (any) 
Quint_Sakugarne	nymph	They might not be directly dangerous, but if they steal your attack wands they WILL use them against you.  It also sucks even more if they steal your amulet of life saving.
ZeffriN	nymph	They can be useful for getting rid of cursed items, though its random so dropping all your other items will help...  though being naked is in itself a risk.

dtype	vibrating_square	On this square you must light up, ring up, and read Rodney's book in order to open a stairwell to Moloch's sanctum, the home of the Amulet.
greycat	vibrating_square	As searching for this square can be quite time-consuming, it's recommended that you find the square (and mark it!) before you kill Rodney.  This saves you from having to deal with him during your search.
Zadir	vibrating_square	"It is in a corridor (not a wall), at least five squares from the side of the map, at least four squares from the top or bottom of the map, not within a circle of eleven squares radius around the upstair, not in a straight line with the upstair, and not on the same square as a trap." (http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/gazetteer/vs.html)
Patashu	vibrating_square	If you're having trouble, try this; drop 1 gold piece on every square the vibrating square is NOT on. It will never move so by deduction you will eventually find it.

paxed	castle	The level is no-teleport, and cannot leave bones.
paxed	castle	Do *not* fill all the trapdoors on this level, because you need to get deeper, and you cannot dig holes in the floor. If you do fill the holes by mistake, you can still levport down from the castle to get below.
Zadir	castle	If you have any musical instrument, you can play a little game of "mastermind" to open the drawbridge. Stand next to the moat and align yourself with the drawbridge, then (a)pply the instrument and choose (n) for improvisation. You'll be prompted to enter a 5 letter combination (A-G), and for every right letter in the wrong space, you hear a tumbler click, and for every right letter in the right space, a gear turns.
aristotle73	castle	Do not fight while standing on the drawbridge.  It is possible for the drawbridge to be destroyed and cause instant death to the player. Casting force bolt while standing on the drawbridge destroys it.
SpeedEvil	castle	A simple tune strategy is to try aaaaa, bbbbb, ... ggggg - and write down the number of gears per note. You now know how many of each note is in the tune.
SpeedEvil	castle	Now - for each position, try playing each note in turn that it could be, padding the rest with x - till you get gears grinding indicating you've found that note.

dtype	mjollnir	The massive hammer hits!!! Lightning strikes you! (The Valkyrie's first sacrifice gift, and one of the better artifacts.) With d24 extra damage, Mjollnir is a fantastic weapon, but it is less useful in the endgame, due to the shock-resistance of many monsters (priests, angels, riders...).
greycat	mjollnir	Mojo (as it's often called) can be thrown at monsters if you have Strength of 25 (gauntlets of power).  In addition, if you're a Valkyrie, it has a 99% chance of returning to your hand afterward.  There is a 0.99% chance it will land at your feet, and a 0.01% chance it will hit you!
Jafet	mjollnir	If you use Mjollnir, expect to collect fewer wands and rings from your vanquished opponents.
ihope	you_get_a_slight_headache	A monster casted "Psi Bolt" at you, and you took 5 damage or less.

konso	konso	Ascensions in chronological order: Wiz Sam Rog Kni Hea
billnyeWRK	credit	When in a shop, any money dropped by you (or placed into containers on the floor of the shop) will add to your credit with that shopkeeper.  [You can check your available credit with the ($) command]
billnyeWRK	credit	When purchasing items, the game will ask whether you wish to use store credit first.  This method is preferable to straight payment because marauding creatures or your pets can pick up the stack of zorkmids and deliver it outside the shop, without affecting shop credit.
billnyeWRK	credit	Doing this intentionally is a great way to multiply your shop credit, to be able to afford those items your pets can't (or won't... useful cursed) steal for you.
billnyeWRK	credit	Note, however, that this is only useful for obtaining items rather than obtaining cash, as the multiplication involved is strictly "on the books"
billnyeWRK	credit	This method .can., however, be used to purchase an expensive uncursed spellbook or weapon, which can be repeately stolen and resold to bleed the shopkeeper dry of funds when you need the cold hard cash.
joshk	fumble	Fumble gloves and boots cause you to be very clumsy, and abuse your dexterity every 5 moves. They are usually cursed. You will trip over objects and yourself, and you will fall down stairs. Watch out!

dtype	werebane	One of many joke monster-specific artifact weapons that is just an obstacle in the way of a good weapon.
itsblah	werebane	Also unrestricts you in silver saber if you got it as a gift, so it isn't a total waste.
Stevie[FP]	werebane	When wielded, protects you from being infected ("You feel feverish.") from a werefoo's bite.

kerio	#nethack:!uptime	I've been up for $UPTIME
nailbunny	cursed_weapon	If the weapon a character is wielded is cursed, it will be welded to the chatacter's hand(s).
nailbunny	cursed_weapon	Characters will be unable to wear or remove gloves or rings with a cursed one-handed weapon. A cursed two-handed weapon is even more debilitating -- characters cannot (a)pply bags or #loot containers until the weapon is removed or uncursed.
nailbunny	cursed_weapon	In addition to techniques that will uncurse any item, a weapon can be uncursed by a non-cursed scroll of enchant weapon.
nailbunny	cursed_weapon	Less traditional methods to remove it include allowing a nymph or monkey to steal it.
paxed	shito	Japanese knife.
Hellzon	broadsword	see {sword_damage}
shevek	fruit_juice	Potion which gives you 30/20/10 nutrition if it's blessed, uncursed, or cursed respectively.

joshk	orcus	Watch out! This chaotic demon, who you'll find on his own special level (Orcus town) on level 10-15 of Gehennom, has a wand of death. He also has a 1/260 chance of summoning Demogorgon each move.
jilles	orcus	Paranoid way of dealing with Orcus: dig down on his level, find the upstairs, burn Elbereth, drop junk object, go up and make Orcus follow you down (first wake him if necessary).
Ian-Keith	orcus	Level 30, AC -6, MR 85, speed 9, base XP 1421, difficulty 36 (from Monster Manual). Attacks include a random magic spell, projectile or melee weaponry, two 3d4 claws, and a strength-drain poison stinger. Watch that /oDeath.
Stevie	you_see_a_puff_of_smoke	A scroll or spellbook on the ground was destroyed by a fire bolt.
shevek	you_see_a_puff_of_smoke	You may also see this when rubbing a magic lamp.  Nothing happened in that case; just try again.
Nodey	strength	Strength (St:) affects your fighting ability (to-hit and damage), carrying capacity, throwing/kicking distance, chances of opening doors, bashing doors or chests. It has a strange scale: 3-18, then 18/01-18/99, followed by 18/**, then 19-25 (gauntlets of power or str rings with 18/**).
Nodey	strength	Dwarves and humans can reach 18/** strength natively. Gnomes and orcs are capable of 18/50, and elves just 18. However, gauntlets of power can override these racial limitations.
Nodey	strength	To-hit bonus in the format of [Strength]=(bonus): [3-5]=(-2). [6-7]=(-1). [8-16]=(+0). [17-18/50]=(+1). [18/51-18/99]=(+2). [18/**-25]=(+3).
Nodey	strength	Damage bonus in the format of [Strength]=(bonus): [3-5]=(-1). [6-15]=(+0). [16-17]=(+1). [18]=(+2); [18/01-18/75]=(+3). [18/76-18/90]=(+4). [18/91-18/99]=(+5). [18/**-25]=(+6).
Nodey	strength	Carrying capacity = ([(Strength + Constitution)/2]+1)*50, capped at 1000.  Strength "carrying points" for this purpose are computed thus: 3-18, 22-25 counts as themselves.  18/01 - 18/31 counts as 19.  18/32 to 18/81 counts as 20.  18/82 to 21 counts as 21.
Nodey	strength	Raised (directly) by: quaffing potions of gain ability, eating royal jelly, giant corpses, tins of spinach (1 point each). Gauntlets of power (at any enchantment) directly raises strength to 25, past racial limitations.
Nodey	strength	Exercised by: attacking monsters; quaffing healing/extra healing; kicking doors; throwing iron balls or boulders; pushing boulders; failing to open doors; hit by nurse; "restored to health" after *cubus; enchant armor without armor; being "stressed" or "strained"; regenerating; hit by electricity or fire as iron golem.
Nodey	strength	Abused by: weak from hunger; kicking stairs, ladder, wall, space, trapped door, or when levitating; damaged by explosion; strangled, choked, crushed, digested, pummeled, damaged by acid; xan prick; *cubus exhaustion; break out of armor; destroy armor without armor; rock and pit traps; force-bolt or magic missile self; lose grip on iron ball; divided as pudding.
Nodey	strength	Strength is not exercised by being burdened, but by being stressed or higher.  This is generally a bad way to do it as ABUSES dexterity, and leads to much death.

paxed	ibmgraphics	Configuration option.  Use IBM extended characters.  Won't work for all terminals.
tweek__	ibmgraphics	If you use XTerm/RXVT/aterm/Eterm/etc. to play Nethack through NAO, and can't seem to get IBMgraphics to display correctly, check out http://tweek.no-ip.org/stuff/lutRS13-ascii.bdf.bz2 for a 13-pt fixed-width Lucida font that (supposedly) works with DEC/IBM/whatever, and looks cool.
tweek__	ibmgraphics	To prepare - decompress the file ($ bunzip2 lutRS13-ascii.bdf.bz2), then use bdftopcf to compile the font ($ bdftopcf lutRS13-ascii.bdf > lutRS13-ascii.pcf), then gzip the resulting file ($ gzip lutRS13-ascii.pcf).
tweek__	ibmgraphics	To install - copy the gzipped, compiled PCF file into any font path specified in your XF86Config or xorg.conf file. I use /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/local/. Then cd to that path and use mkfontdir (# mkfontdir) to regenerate the path's fonts.dir listing, then use xset ($ xset fp rehash) to have X look for new fonts. (You could also restart X, but, meh.)
tweek__	ibmgraphics	To use - tell your favorite terminal emulator to use the font -b&h-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-sans-13-125-75-75-m-80-ascii-0 (on many systems -*-lucidatypewriter-medium-*-*-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-ascii-0 will be enough). Most of these accept a command-line argument of -fn; for something more permanent, add an entry to .Xresources like Aterm*font: -*-lucida...
tweek__	ibmgraphics	Report any bugs, occurences of artifacts (annoying pixels that remain after redraws) or general ideas (I plan, for example, to round the corners off eventually) to tweek.20k@gmail.com
tweek__	ibmgraphics	If you use Windows, use PuTTY as a telnet client (google for it). Type in 'nethack.alt.org' under 'Host Name (or IP address)' and check 'Telnet', then hit 'Open' to connect. To have PuTTY translate IBMgraphics characters correctly, tell it to use code page 437 (on the left side, under Window -> Translation, change 'Use font encoding' to 'CP437'). You can save these settings by going back to 'Session', clicking 'Default Settings' and hi

Cyde	magic_trap	A trap.  There is a 1/30 chance of getting these results: It says "You are caught in a magical explosion!". Lose d10 HP; if you survive, "Your body absorbs some of the magical energy!". Power points increased to max+2, and the trap vanishes.
Cyde	magic_trap	Otherwise, a random effect can occur as follows:
Cyde	magic_trap	9/20: "You are momentarily blinded by a flash of light!" (If already blind, "You hear a deafening roar!"; if blinding resistant (Sunsword, poly), "You see a flash of light!".) Blinds for 9+d5 turns, creates d4 monsters around you.
Cyde	magic_trap	1/20: Same as fire trap ("A tower of flame erupts from the floor!". If not fire resistant, lose 2d4 HP, max HP is reduced by a number between 0 and the HP you lost.  Chance of armour being damaged and flammables in inventory being burnt/boiled.)
Cyde	magic_trap	1/20: "You feel charismatic!" Gain 1 CHA, and tame the monsters immediately around you, and this form of taming can't be resisted.
Cyde	magic_trap	1/20: "You feel like someone is helping you." (If hallucinating, "You feel in touch with the Universal Oneness.") Acts as uncursed scroll of remove curse; uncurse loadstones, worn and wielded items. Remove ball and chain if being punished.
Cyde	magic_trap	2/20: Nothing happens, and does it quietly.
Cyde	magic_trap	6/20: Nothing happens, and any of a number of random messages may be displayed.
Cyde	magic_trap	Thanks to Dylan O'Donnell < http://www.nethack.de/spoiler/magic_trap_messages.txt >

scwizard	very_fast	If you've very fast due to a temporary effect, getting hit by a skeleton, shade or a wand of slow monster will end that effect
dtype	polypile	Zapping a wand (or spell) of polymorph on a pile of objects changes them into different objects of the same class (such as a light scroll to an enchant armor scroll).
dtype	polypile	Stacks of objects have a chance of reducing in size and all objects have chances of disappearing during polypile, especially wands, and some objects have chances of merging and turning into golems.
dtype	polypile	Popular polypile objectives are "oLS, scrolls of genocide, enchant wpn/armor, remove curse, potions of gain ability/level, full healing, all spellbooks, wands of cancellation, rings, and magical armor.
dtype	polypile	See magical_armor and magical_tools for items considered magical when polypiling (greater chance of turning into other magical items).
dasunt	polypile	Elven cloaks and elven boots can both be safely enchanted at +5 or below (leading to a +7 enchantment if you are lucky) and both are considered 'magical'.  2) Polypiled armor keeps the same enchantment.  3) Profit!!!
Flippy	polypile	Items appearing in quantities of 2 or more have a (quantity in 1000) chance of merging into one object.
markos_64	polypile	Items also have a probability of "shuddering": 1/3 if a wand or cursed, 1/8 if uncursed, 1/12 if blessed (if in quantities greater than 4, 100%, 1/4, and 1/6, respectively).  This will decrease the quantity of the item randomly, cause any remainder not to be polymorphed, and has a one in (luck + 45) chance of creating a golem.

jilles	invocation	The exact procedure is to stand on the vibrating square, light the Candelabrum (7 candles must be attached), ring the Bell, and read the Book.

SpeedEvil	quaff_test	How to ID potions, with no ID scrolls. There are of course risks, but these can be minimised.
SpeedEvil	quaff_test	First, apply a potion. This will find oil.
SpeedEvil	quaff_test	Next, dip an arrow, or other projectile into the potion. This will poison the arrow, if the potion is sickness, and ID it. If the arrows are already poisoned and the coating wears off, it's some sort of healing potion.
SpeedEvil	quaff_test	If the arrow turns into something else at this step, you've found polymorph.
Eidolos	quaff_test	Dip a unicorn horn into the potion. If it clears, it is hallucination, blindness or confusion. Dipping a horn can also make sickness turn into fruit juice, but we've already covered that.
SpeedEvil	quaff_test	Now, the remaining nasties are sleeping, paralysis, and to a lesser extent levitation.
SpeedEvil	quaff_test	If you have a few hundred turns of food, you can safely test levitation, but paralysis and sleeping are best tested in a closet with elbereth engraved.
SpeedEvil	quaff_test	Clear potions are always water, smoky potions in addition to their normal effect may give a wish (see {smoky_potion}) and milky may yield ghosts.
SpeedEvil	quaff_test	Also, see help entries on 'potion' and 'nymph'
PsyMar	quaff_test	Note that the effects of sleeping potions can be countered by sleep resistance or free action, so if you have one of the two and sleeping is the only 'nasty' potion remaining, you can go ahead and quaff test.
joshk	mind_flayer	ACHTUNG! These fellows will easily lock on to you if you're near them and you are telepathic. When they strike, they will eat your brain. They strike several times in one turn, and when you get flayed you will forget random dungeon levels and item identifications permanently.
joshk	mind_flayer	Your helmet helps prevent flaying, especially if greased. Usually, you should polymorph these badass dudes, or have them get acquainted with a wand of death or a trice corpse.
joshk	mind_flayer	Eating their corpses may raise INT ("Yum! This is real brain food! You feel smart!")

PsyMar	intelligence	Along with Charisma, intelligence cannot be exercised, but instead can only be increased with blessed potions of enlightenment, potions of gain ability or helm of brilliance, or by eating a [master] mind flayer corpse (50% chance).
PsyMar	intelligence	Wisdom rather than Intelligence governs spellcasting success for Healers, Knights, Monks, Priests, and Valkyries.

dasunt	boots	There are ten types of boots in the game.  Low boots (walking shoes), high boots (jackboots) and iron shoes (hard shoes) have the same appearance each game.  Elven, kicking, fumble, levitation, jumping, speed and water walking boots have their unidentified descriptions randomized per game:  mud, buckled, riding, snow, hiking, combat, and jungle boots.
greycat	boots	All of the randomized boots are organic (can rot from brown P attack) except for kicking boots, which are metal.
Zealot	boots	Elven and kicking boots are cheap; base price 8. Fumbling and levitation boots are 30 zorkmids, and almost always cursed. Speed, water walking, and jumping boots are 50 zorkmids, and do their job just as well if cursed.
HanClinto	boots	The randomized descriptions of the boots can also give other effects. For instance, boots with the un-id'd description of "snow boots" will keep you from slipping and making noise while on ice, and "riding boots" give you a riding bonus.

billnye	tin_whistle	(But we suspect the source is lying to us.)

dtype	wish	Allows you to obtain most items in the game. You can wish for, but will not receive items which produce wishes (wand of wishing or magic lamp; you *can* wish for smoky potions, though). If your luck is negative, a wish is likely to fail. If you have reason to believe it may be (cursed luckstone, sokoban mishaps, friday the 13th, etc.), save it for later.
casmith789	wish	Good first wishes include "blessed figurine of an Archon" (for a pacifist), "blessed greased +3 grey dragon scale mail" (for a character without MR), "blessed greased +3 silver dragon scale mail" (for a character without reflection), "blessed greased fixed +3 speed boots" (for a character with MR & reflection). +2 or +3 is personal preference.
dtype	wish	If from a wand of wishing, and you haven't id'd charging scrolls, the first wish should _always_ be "2 blessed greased scrolls of charging", or a magic marker to write the scrolls of charging (for the wand) if you've id'd charging, but don't have any.
greycat	wish	If you wish for an artifact, the artifact may not be created ("For a moment, you feel something in your hands, but it disappears!").  This will happen 100% of the time if it's your own quest artifact.  The chance to successfully wish for the artifact is 2/(n+1) where n is the number of artifacts already existing in the game.
greycat	wish	Wishing for another class's quest artifact will blast you for 4d10 damage (and you also get blasted when you use such an item), so you fountain gamblers may not survive such a wish.  You cannot wish for any artifact guaranteed to be found in the game (i.e. your quest artifact, any of the invocation items, or the Amulet of Yendor.)

GreyKnight	punishment	When throw/kicking objects, iron balls get a larger range than other objects of their weight since they can easily roll along the ground.
scwizard	punishment	When dragging the ball, you move at half speed, and it causes you pain if you go downstairs or fall.

braindancer	off_with_her_head	A throne room message.
paxed	alignment	"Alignment" refers to your standing with your god.
paxed	alignment	Its initial value is 0 for character classes CPTVW, and 10 for character classes ABHKMRoRaS.
Stevie-O	alignment	Its maximum value starts at 10 and is increased by 1 every 200 turns (so at T:199, max align is 10, at T:200 max align is 11).
Eidolos	alignment	Since alignment is a signed 32-bit integer, the minimum alignment is -2,147,483,648. There seems to be some over/underflow protection (so you can't have +2bil alignment).
Eidolos	alignment	The exact formula for maximum alignment is (10+turns/200). In the spoilers, this number is called L. For example, killing your quest leader sets your alignment to -L/2.
Stevie-O	alignment	To do the quest you must have align >= 20, which means you absolutely cannot possibly do the quest before turn 2000, no matter how many wraith corpses you eat or !oGL you quaff.

Eidolos	slow_digestion	With two rings of slow digestion, you can go indefinitely without losing any nutrition. The hunger of each ring hand is calculated on different turns. Wear both rings.

KittyRawr	your_quickness_feels_more_natural	You gained the speed intrinsic while wearing speed boots. You are now very fast.
ek|M	you_hear_your_own_heartbeat	You (a)pplied a cursed stethoscope (50% chance).
dtype	grease	Greased metal items are unlikely to rust, greased helms help prevent mind flayer attacks, and greased sacks are good for waterproofing against items inside. Just (a)pply grease to items to slather it on.
dasunt	grease	A greased robe, cloak, or wrapping prevents an eel's grabbing attack (can be worn off), and if you aren't wearing one of those, greased armor will do the same.
jilles	grease	After it has protected an item, the grease may wear off. (1/3 chance)
itsblah	grease	Grease is not always effective when used on cursed armor, and may not help to stop grabbing attacks, prevent flayings, or stop erosion.
itsblah	grease	Grease can cause items to slip when thrown, and allows you to kick the item farther than it normally can go (1-3 squares)
Stevie[FP]	grease	Avoid greasing items while standing on the downstairs, because if the grease is cursed, it will get on your fingers and cause you to drop your weapon.
Cyde	grease	Even if a piece of armor is already rustproof, if you tangle with a rust monster the grease will dissolve.  This applies to other corrosive attacks.  So always check to make sure that the layer of grease is intact.
Stevie[FP]	grease	You can also use a noncursed can of grease to untrap a squeaky board.
jilles	followers	Monsters which follow you across staircases, level teleports, trapdoors etc. are the Wizard of Yendor, angry shopkeepers, gremlins, stalkers, salamanders, ghosts, shades, mercenaries (soldiers etc. and watchmen/captains), Croesus, all quest nemeses, all zombies (Z except ghoul, skeleton), all i, t, A, T, &, V, W, and pets.
_bryce	followers	Sleeping followers will not follow. Remember this if you have stealth and are trying to use levelporting to lure wraiths from a graveyard. Monsters with the Amulet of Yendor won't follow across levels. Monsters other than the Wizard of Yendor and shopkeepers won't follow if they're fleeing unless you have the Amulet of Yendor.
Eidolos	followers	Note that liches are NOT followers, but they will escape up stairs if you are nearby and they are deeply hurt. (They're very sensitive, you know.)

Patashu	amulet_of_strangulation	Make sure it's not cursed when you put it on; if it is, prayer may be your only option. And it will be cursed about 90% of the time.
Patashu	amulet_of_strangulation	These will NOT auto-curse, so if you know an un-ID'd amulet is uncursed it is safe to put on.

Irashtar	palantir_of_westernesse	in the old versions, the elf quest artifact was this chaotic cystal ball. carrying gave ESP, hungerless regeneration, and half spell damage. #invokeing acted like a blessed scroll of taming
Poeir	armor_class	Armor class affects the chance of your being hit.  The lower it is, the harder it is for an opponent to hit you.  Ways to lower your armor class are to wear nondamaged armor with a nonnegative enchantment, buying protection from a priest (for 400*xp_level to 600*xp_level-1 zorkmids), getting protection from your god (by #praying at an altar with high enough luck and telepathy, speed, and stealth), or casting the protection spell.
Poeir	armor_class	You can also improve your armor class by wearing a ring of protection.
greycat	armor_class	Other ways of not getting hit (besides AC) are invisibility and displacement.
Grunt	armor_class	Armor affects monster's to-hit roll against you - the value of your AC is added to their to-hit roll, unless your AC is less than zero, in which case a random number between 0 and your armor class is added to their to-hit.
Grunt	armor_class	Further, if your AC is less than zero, a random number between 0 and  its magnitude is subtracted from any physical damage dealt.  Non-physical attacks still deal normal damage.
Zeffrin	water_troll	Eaten: water troll   Nutr: 350
SpeedEvil	rnl	Rather complicated function used in the source to get a random number from 0 to x-1, very heavily influenced by luck. A calculator is available at http://klozoff.ms11.net/cgi-bin/nethack-rnl-calculator.pl
BTrebor	(ot	see {Bag_of_tricks}
dasunt	helm_of_brilliance	Unidentified appearance is either the crested, etched, plumed or visored helmet.  Adds its enchantment to your intelligence and wisdom when worn.
jilles	helm_of_brilliance	Does not hinder spellcasting, even though it is made of metal.
jilles	helm_of_brilliance	Does not help prevent death from brainlessness, for example with a +5 helm of brilliance you will die of brainlessness if your intelligence falls below 8.
PsyMar	helm_of_brilliance	As a fortune cookie may tell you, not to be taken lightly.
CydeWeys	dragon_scales	All dragon scales lower AC by 3 and weigh 40.  Reading a scroll of enchant armor will convert them into dragon scale mail, the best armor available.
CydeWeys	dragon_scales	They provide different resistances depending on what color they are.
Eidolos	dragon_scales	If you use a blessed scroll of enchant armor, the resultant mail will have its enchantment increased by 1, and the mail will be blessed. If uncursed scroll, no change in enchantment, and the scales become uncursed if cursed.
SpeedEvil	dragon_scales	Also see {turn_undead}
Eidolos	#nethack:!roles	Ascend them in _this_ order: $SHUFFLE(Arc|Bar|Cav|Hea|Kni|Mon|Pri|Rog|Ran|Sam|Tou|Val|Wiz).
paxed	wand	You can zap a wand with 'z', apply it with 'a' to break it, or use 'E' to engrave with it.
paxed	wand	Base prices for wands -- 100: light, nothing.  150: digging, enlightenment, locking, magic missile, make invisible, opening, probing, secret door detection, slow monster, speed monster, striking, undead turning.  175: cold, fire, lightning, sleep.  200: cancellation, create monster,  polymorph, teleportation.  500: death, wishing.
Zadir	wand	Charging wands is safe once. Subsequently there's a 0.3%, 2.3%, 7.8%, 18.7%, 36.5%, 62.9%, 100% chance of exploding the wand. Wands can never be charged to 8:0. Wands of wishing can only be charged once. An exploding wand does up to 2/3 of your max hp damage.
Eidolos	wand	Cursed wands have a 1% chance of exploding when zapped; this does 1 to 6 points of damage for each charge in the wand, plus an additional 2 to 12 points of damage, and abuses your strength.
Stevie	wand	However, this 1% chance does not occur when (E)ngraving with the wand.
Fennec	wand	If someone is 'killed by a wand', that's specifically referring to a wand of striking.
pak21	wand	A wand with zero charges has a 1/121 chance of "wresting" a last charge from the wand; after this happens the wand is destroyed.

Eidolos	eidolos'_library	Wizards always start with a blessed spellbook of force bolt. If you also start with a wand of polymorph, you can poly the spellbook and read it. Repeat a few times to greatly expand your starting repertoire.
Eidolos	eidolos'_library	You can also polymorph your second book at the same time, but you run a greater risk of shuddering, and it's really only worthwhile if the second book is blessed (so you are guaranteed to learn the spells). You shouldn't be tempted to poly your pet at the same time. You can kill your pet with a bad polymorph (so wait a bit first)
Eidolos	eidolos'_library	The big criticism of this technique is that after you forget the spells you're in trouble. My response is thus: better to start with the spell and forget it than to never have learned it at all (especially in the first 20k turns when the going is tough for wizards). If you really need the spell, you can write the book with the marker (guaranteed to work since you have ID'd the book)
elajt	bear_trap	Jumping out of bear traps will wound your leg.
Stevie-O	bear_trap	If you trigger one, you will NOT be trapped if you are polymorphed into any of the following: acid blob, blue/spotted/ochre jelly, small/large/giant mimic, fog cloud, yellow/black light, gray ooze, brown/black pudding, green slime, jellyfish, any vortex, air/fire elemental, or wraith
Stevie-O	bear_trap	Also, tiny monsters: giant/soldier/fire ant, killer/queen bee, giant beetle, chickatrice, homunculus, imp, leprechaun, sewer/giant/rabid/were rat, cave spider, centipede, grid bug, xan, bat, garter snake, newt, gecko, iguana, or lizard
Stevie-O	bear_trap	Trying to move diagonally is guaranteed to get you out of the trap in 4 to 7 turns. If you try to move only horizontally or vertically, you're at the mercy of the RNG (it can take over 35 turns!)
_bryce	bear_trap	Although heavy, it can be carried when disarmed and deployed by applying it. This is useful for hunting unicorns.
TheShrewdDude	bear_trap	If you pet is caught in one, you can use #untrap to remove it from the trap.
TheShrewdDude	bear_trap	If you fail, you will harm your pet.
itsblah	secret_door_detection	Detects hidden doors, corridors, traps besides statue traps, mimics, and unseen monsters in a radius of 8.
paxed	dwarvish_mithril-coat	Lowers AC by 6, and does not rust.  Weighs 150, very light for its AC.
dasunt	dwarvish_mithril-coat	A good choice of armor for early non-magic users.  A third of the weight of plate mail, yet provides almost the same protection, and offers more magic cancellation. Look for it in the mines.
greycat	dwarvish_mithril-coat	Gives magic cancellation level 3 (a.k.a. "MC3").
paxed	dwarvish_mithril-coat	Mithril-coat is hyphenated.
paxed	s'em	short for slash'em.
kerio92	stupid_ascension_tricks	Things like ascending with one of every kind of amulet, or ascending with every color of dragon scale mail. See http://www.thinksystem.net/nethack/
greycat	unicorn_horn	The horn of the unicorn is an effective remedy for a wide variety of ailments, including food poisoning, blindness, confusion, stunning, hallucination and reduced vital statistics.  A blessed one is more efficient (which is important when haste is of utmost importance). Enchantment gives no bonus.
n1ffo	unicorn_horn	The unicorn horn has a natural +1 to-hit when used as a weapon, and does d12 damage to both small and large creatures. Unfortunately it's a two-handed weapon.
dasunt	unicorn_horn	Good polypile fodder, since it is relatively common and is a 'magical tool'.
greycat	unicorn_horn	A cursed unicorn horn will inflict a malady upon you (including possibly confusion); If you use it to confuse yourself, just be sure you have a non-cursed one handy to cure deadly ailments.
Eidolos	unicorn_horn	Dipping a unicorn horn into a potion of blindness, confusion, or hallucination will make the potion into uncursed water. Dipping a horn into sickness will make fruit juice (cursed if the horn is cursed).
SpeedEvil	unicorn_horn	See {turn_undead}
Nodey	nethacklinux	see {nethack floppy}
paxed	liquor_emporium	A shop.  Sells and buys potions.
lorimer	ill	The first hit that makes you Ill will give you 20 turns to live, plus a random number between 0 and your CON.
lorimer	ill	All subsequent hits will reduce that time to 1/3 of its current value, plus one turn.
lorimer	ill	The practical upshot of all this is that the worst possible progression is 20 -> 8 -> 4... and so on, so you need to kill whatever's making you sick before it hits you a 3rd time.
ZeffriN	head_spins	You head spins as something blocks the spell.  This is from trying to cast magic mapping on a level which is flagged as no map.
paxed	chugging_sound	Some intelligent monster drank a potion.

Eidolos	bag_of_tricks	Unlike wands you cannot wrest the last charge out of a bag of tricks.
Bluhd	cancellation	Can be used to remove curses, enchantments, and otherwise nullify your equipment.
PsyMar	cancellation	see also http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/343/wan2-343.html#cancelling
billnye	cancellation	It's a bad idea to put a wand of cancellation into a bag of holding, see {boh} for other dangers
rlbond86	cancellation	Uses for cancellation include cancelling your inventory and nullifying enemies' special attacks. While cancelling yourself nullifies your inventory, this isn't the case for cancelled monsters.
paxed	water_elemental	Slow (Spd 6), but does pretty hefty damage (5d6).  Poison and stoning resistant.  Does not leave a corpse.
Feory	water_elemental	Hit, step back, rinse & repeat

paxed	gold_vault	Unsurprisingly, they contain gold.  You can find a teleport trap into this near the text "ad aerarium".
greycat	gold_vault	Also known as the "magic memory vault".  One of these vaults may contain a magic portal leading to Fort Ludios, the home of Croesus (level 11-Medusa).
paxed	gold_vault	Special level sounds include someone counting money, footsteps of a guard on patrol, or, if the vault has been robbed, someone searching.
ZeroOne	gold_vault	There are no doors in vaults, so if you can't teleport or dig your way out, you will have to wait for the guard to appear and escort you out. This way, you will have to drop all your gold, though.
SpeedEvil	gold_vault	If you can't find the 'ad aerarium' around the walls of some room, then you can either dig out every wall, search a lot, or dig everywhere a 4*4 space (2*2 vault and the walls) may be. (Object/gold detection may be helpful here.)
SpeedEvil	gold_vault	Unless he has been killed, telling the guard your name is 'Croesus', 'Kroisos', or 'Creosote' will make him go away. The guard will NOT let you out.
jeddy00	gold_vault	A source of easily obtainable human corpses.
greycat	blade_damage	(Damages are shown as S/L for "small/large" monsters.) dagger: 1d4/1d3. elven dagger: 1d5/1d3. orcish dagger: 1d3/1d3. silver dagger: 1d4/1d3. athame: 1d4/1d3. scalpel: 1d3/1d3. knife: 1d3/1d2. stiletto: 1d3/1d2. worm tooth: 1d2/1d2. crysknife: 1d10/1d10.

Patashu	while_helpless	The list includes: frozen by a floating eye, paralyzed by a ghoul/etc, praying unsuccessfully, reading a book unsuccessfully, fainted from rotten food, fainted from lack of food, vomiting, taking articles of armour on/off...

jilles	crowning	Greatly increases prayer timeout.
itsblah	crowning	Crowning also unrestricts you in your crowning artifact (regardless of receiving it or not) and your current weapon if you do not receive a gift; it also rustproofs and fixes your current weapon, and sets it to +1  if it was below that.
Eidolos	crowning	Changing your alignment (either through a badly-aligned #offer or wearing the helmet) doesn't remove your crowning.
dho	crowning	00:01 < kriebly> getting crowned by your god gives little benefit, but it does look nice on your resume.

billnye	reading_prob	see {spell_learning}
aristotle73	unaligned_altar	This altar belongs to the evil god Moloch.  If it's in your Quest, you can safely try to convert it via sacrificing.  If in Gehennom (including the Valley), doing so will anger your God and nullify your ability to pray until your God has been appeased.

Stevie-O	puddingbane	Usually a highly rusted iron helmet or skeleton key/lock pick, used to split brown and black puddings in order to farm them. The name is a joke based on the many crap monster-specific artifacts such as Dragonbane, Trollsbane, etc.
Elliott	puddingbane	You should use an orcish dagger or a scalpel (knife if you can't find a scalpel) not a key, whichever you are unskilled in. Engrave it to -3, and the damage done when rusted should be 1 per hit. With a non-weapon, damage will be 1 + str bonus per hit.
billnye	puddingbane	the drawback to using a weapon instead of a tool is that your altar prayers (you are farming an altar, right?) will occasionally result in the weapon being repaired.
azgor	puddingbane	You can solve this problem by switching to your alternate weapon before praying.  It's a good idea to have a proper weapon handy anyway just in case something nasty sneaks up on you.
azgor	puddingbane	Unarmed combat while wearing iron gloves or an iron ring will not split puddings.  However, you can split puddings with these items if you wield them.  (iron wands work too when wielded)

Stevie	you_feel_in_good_health_again	You #prayed, and your god restored an ability that had been drained (e.g. strength, by poisoning). This acts like a blessed !oRestoreAbility, healing all attributes to their previous highest value.
Eidolos	ipbt	A "high-tech ttyrec player"; ipbt allows you to rewind, and go directly to specific frames, and so on.
Eidolos	ipbt	Only downside is ipbt requires a lot of preprocessing time for a ttyrec, so it's handy to keep an ordinary ttyrec player (like jilles' playttyrec) around as well.
Eidolos	ipbt	Download it at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/ipbt/ (it's written by the same guy who made PuTTY!)

_Q	weight_test	If, upon placing the items in the bag, you become unburdened, then you possess a bag of holding.
dasunt	rider	Traditionally, there are four riders - Death, Famine, Pestilence, and War.
dasunt	rider	You'll see the first three riders on the astral plane. Death drains hps, famine makes you hungry, pestilence makes you sick. All three are & symbols, all are resistant to almost everything, and eating their corpses is instantly fatal. The fourth rider is not as obvious, but if you look at the source, chat with one of the riders, or try to tin one of the riders, you'll figure it out. (Big hint: He or she's shown by a @)
greycat	rider	The three riders have no distance attacks, but are quite potent in melee.  They are best killed with magic missiles, or thrown/fired traditional missiles, or wand/finger of death (except for Death).

Babamus	juiblex	The only monster which you can just kill once; he is stoning resistant and doesn't leave a corpse.
kenzie	juiblex	Flies, floats, flows under doors, amphibious, headless, sees invisible, acidic and poisonous if eaten.

Nodey	arch-lichen	Arch-lichens are small creatures, very fast, and can do up to 6x9d12 with its numerous touches of death. They are not genocidable, do not respect Elbereth, and cannot be shielded from by #praying invulnerability. Attempting to eat the corpse of an Arch-lichen will cause the server to seek the nearest bones file and polymorph you indefinitely into that individual.
Nodey	arch-lichen	They have AC -78, MR100, and have intrinsic reflection. They are capable of casting the Groping of Death. When not Groping, its attacks brings swift retribution unmatched by even the Riders. Along with disenchantment ability, arch-lichens are THE most formidable monsters in the NetHack bestiary.
lament	arch-lichen	Arch-lichens multiply when hit by any weapon or beam, with the new lichen having twice the HP of the old one. They are also capable of summoning demons and insects. They will teleport next to you, even from a different dungeon level, including ones you haven't visited, when the time is "appropriate".
Nodey	arch-lichen	Arch-lichens, or Fwagglebrapo in Quenya, are a deadly race of...  things. They were first fwapped into creation by the omnipotent RNG for the sole purpose of executing overtly lucky adventurers. In Its omnipotence, however, the RNG discovered that he had made a creature that even He cannot kill. Naturally, it follows that no divine intervention can protect an adventurer from the wrath of an arch-lichen.
Nodey	arch-lichen	Really bad and rudimentary patch by Nodey at http://sfcalc.sourceforge.net/nethack-3.4.3-arch-lichen.diff ; Windows console compiles for said patch http://sfcalc.sourceforge.net/nethack-3.4.3-arch-lichen.zip

dasunt	famine	Nasty fellow that's found on the astral plane.  Attack makes you hungry (makes you lose 40-79 nutrition).  Resistant to almost everything.
Danirijeka	famine	It is not resistant to drain life and death magic, though, so those two work like a charm. Especially if you can repeatedly drain his level to the point that any leveldrain is an instakill.
dasunt	famine	Revelation 6:4-5 "..And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.  And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine."

Stevie[FP]	displacement	Cloaks of displacement provide MC2.

dasunt	magical_armor	Magical armor has a 54% chance of turning into non-magical armor when polymorphed.
dasunt	gauntlets_of_dexterity	Sometimes abbreviated as GoD, these leather gauntlets add their enchantment to your dexterity.  Good choice for spellcasters.  If not enchanted, they will not auto-ID when worn.
dtype	cockatrice	A very dangerous opponent due to its ability to stone. Kill it from range or after cancelling it, and be _very_ careful with the corpse, if you get near it at all. If you do feel the stoning process, eat a lizard or acidic corpse immediately.
greycat	cockatrice	The live cockatrice is far less dangerous than the dead cockatrice.  The corpse of this beast should be treated as radioactive waste -- do not let it come into contact with your bare skin.
epyokkim	cockatrice	It is best to put a fresh cockatrice corpse into a bag, where it will rot, instead of allowing a nearby monster wield it against you.
racoon	cockatrice	Of course, don't have YASD (yet another stupid death) by putting it in your bag without gloves. Also, don't #offer it without gloves. All these warnings can be ignored if you have stoning resistance
koyaan	cockatrice	You can also get petrified by falling while wielding a corpse with gloves on.
Zadir	cockatrice	Be mindful of what inventory letter is assigned to the corpse, having it on "y", "n", or "e" is a recipe for disaster.
Zadir	cockatrice	Also try not to make the mistake of pressing e - (letter) instead of w - (letter) when playing hastily, that's another way to die stupidly.
PsyMar	cockatrice	There are 47 cockatrice-related ways to be petrified. Of these, 13 involve a live cockatrice.
PsyMar	cockatrice	"It is the letter 'c' and not 'e' that changes status to statue." -- rumors.tru
doy	cockatrice	If it's a new moon and you don't have a lizard corpse in your main inventory, a successful hiss attack is guaranteed to begin the stoning process, while it is only a 10% chance otherwise. It is not an attack that is affected by magic cancellation.
scwizard	cockatrice	Their corpses have a chance of granting poison resistance, if you're polymorphed into something stoning-resistant. Otherwise this is kind of irrelevant.
Zauren	cockatrice	Cockatrice eggs, wielded or thrown, cause insta-stoning. Polymorphing into one and using your own unhatched eggs is handy, but you get a luck penalty for each you break.
marcmagus	cockatrice	A cockatrice will hiss on 1/3 of successful touch attacks if it has not been cancelled.
Zeffrin	cockatrice	Eaten: cockatrice   Nutr: 30   Effects: Petrify     Intrinsic: Poison: 33%
paxed	diablo	Rather successful commercial game that borrowed shamelessly from the roguelike genre.  Graphics intensive and real-time.
greycat	diablo	Apparently, unlike Angband, "immune" in Diablo actually means "resistant".
ix_	potion_of_acid	Does 1d10 damage if it gets wet.
Calamarain	potion_of_acid	Drinking one of these will stop the stoning process - a good way for a vegan/vegetarian to keep the conduct in case of a stoning emergency

greycat	rogue	In addition to being the primal game of nethack's genre, Rogue is also a character class.  The rogue is always chaotic, but may be human or orc.  The rogue can achieve Expert skill in dagger, knife, short sword, crossbow, dart, two-weapon combat (!) and bare-handed combat.  They get a backstab bonus against fleeing monsters with single weapons.
Chilliwack	rogue	They can become skilled in broadsword, long sword, scimitar, saber, club, mace, and shuriken, and in divination, escape, and matter spells.
greycat	rogue	Rogues are stealthy from the time they set foot in the Dungeons of Doom, and they learn Searching at level 10.
paxed	rogue	Rogue rank titles: Footpad (xplvl 1-2), Cutpurse (3-5), Rogue (6-9), Pilferer (10-13), Robber (14-17), Burglar (18-21), Filcher (22-25), Magsman/Magswoman (26-29), Thief (30)
greycat	rogue	The final level of the rogue quest requires trickery to complete. See {rogue quest}.
CydeWeys	rogue	When attacking a fleeing monster, a rogue gets a 1d(XL) damage bonus, unless they are twoweaponing.
Eidolos	rogue	Magicbane is a good wish for a Rogue. They're probably going to get Expert in daggers, and its athame Elbereth ability makes backstabbing a tactical nuke. Don't forget the magic attack effects, curse absorption, and MR, either!

tweek__	ascension_for_dummies_2	Handle cockatrice or chickatrice corpses with extreme caution. Do not kick them without boots. Do not pick them up without gloves. If you wield one (to stone enemies) do not explore an area while wielding it - you might fall in a pit. Do not consort with a succubus or incubus or attack a nymph (they might take off your gloves) while wielding it.
tweek__	ascension_for_dummies_2	Do not hit a 'trice bare-handed. If a 'trice leaves a corpse, do not let a monster use it against you - if you can't pick it up or kick it around, and you don't want to wait around for it to rot, at least engrave Elbereth underneath it, or move a boulder onto it. Do not explore a level while blinded, especially one where you've just killed a 'trice, if you're not wearing gloves (you'll feel it)..
tweek__	ascension_for_dummies_2	Use 'm' to move around a level without feeling objects on the ground if you are blind and are not wearing gloves. Do not try to walk over a 'trice corpse that is on ice or if you have fumbling boots on. If you see a 'trice corpse and want to grab it, check (with ^) to make sure it did not die by falling into a pit.
tweek__	ascension_for_dummies_2	If you get a message like "You are slowing down.", you are turning to stone. Cast Stone to Flesh on yourself, quaff a potion of acid, eat an acidic corpse, or #pray. (Most ascension kits contain a lizard corpse, which never rot, for this purpose.) Many corpse-related stonings are instadeaths, however! Above all: DO NOT eat a cockatrice or a chickatrice!

CydeWeys	t-shirt	Costs 2 zorkmids and weighs 5.
paxed	convert	If you convert to another alignment before you've done your quest, the game becomes unwinnable, and the best you can do is escape the dungeon with The Book and The Candelabrum.
paxed	convert	Helm of Opposite Alignment doesn't help, as your quest leader detects your real alignment through it.
tsuteiuQ	convert	Conversion happens when you attempt to convert an altar (by doing #offer) while your alignment is negative.
jilles	convert	Conversion also happens when offering a unicorn of your alignment on an altar of another alignment.
paxed	protection_racket	A way of playing the beginning game, where you'll try to reach the Minetown while still being on experience level 1, so you can buy protection from the priest cheaply.
dasunt	protection_racket	Probably one of the better ways of dying, but some classes tend to be better at pulling this off then others.  Healers, with their potions and high amount of starting money is a good example.
Zadir	protection_racket	There is a way to do this later on in the game, with a means of draining your own level (Wraiths are ok for this, but pile on the armor so they don't do much damage, important since you'll have low health afterwards, and remove ALL your magic cancellation so that they can still drain your level), and at least 3200 gold (the most needed for 9 levels of AC at XL 1). Bring your level drain tool, or lure the wraith..he
Zadir	protection_racket	to the nearest priest, make a safe spot (Burned Elbereth or a dropped scare monster scroll), and either throw the drain level tool <, or let the wraith hit you, while keeping a careful eye on your health. Wraiths do 1d6 damage AFTER the level drain, so keep that in mind and have full health before each drain at levels under 5.
Zadir	protection_racket	Ideally, you'll want to have the safe square next to the altar that the priest is roaming around, and the temple walls intact, so try to either kill any nearby burrowers before starting (usually dwarves, if this is in minetown), or patch any holes with boulders, to prevent monster interference.
Zadir	protection_racket	If you want to do it right away, try choosing dwarf or gnome for your starting race, then the majority of gnomes and dwarves that spawn in the mine will be peaceful, easing your descent to minetown.

GreyKnight	cockatrice_egg	You can also throw or use a sling if you need to, but this has a much higher chance of missing.
GreyKnight	cockatrice_egg	They can be safely handled without wearing gloves, as all the nastiness is in the yolk.

raxvulpine	troll_farming	If you want to collect lots of deathdrops without having people harsh on you for farming puddings, try troll farming! Trolls can death-drop items each time they regenerate, and so you can get a lot of loot from a troll if you're patient.
raxvulpine	troll_farming	If you have carnivorous pets, they will eat the troll corpses, and there goes the family farm, so be sure to keep your cats and dogs locked away. If the troll is too high-level for you, use Stormy or the Staff to drain them down.
raxvulpine	troll_farming	If the troll isn't coming back to life quick enough for you, No Problem! Zap it with a wand of undead turning. For maximum efficiency, line up a few troll corpses for this.
raxvulpine	troll_farming	The best place to do this is likely the barbarian quest, where there are a lot of trolls just waiting to be looted, but anywhere you can reverse gencoide trolls is a fine place to get started.

Eidolos	bribery	You can bribe a member of the Yendorian army (soldier, sergeant, lieutenant, or captain) by throwing gold at him. You cannot bribe watchmen or watch captains.
Eidolos	bribery	No matter how much you throw, there's always a constant 1 in 3 chance of failure.
Eidolos	bribery	The amount you have to throw is modified by mercenary type (soldier: X=100, sergeant: X=250, lieutenant: X=500, captain: X=750), your current visible gold, your experience level, and charisma.
Eidolos	bribery	The exact formula is: X + (visible gold + experience_level*Y)/charisma, where Y is a random integer on [0,4]. If you've thrown over this amount (and had succeeded in the constant 33% failcheck) you'll pacify the mercenary. Note that visible gold is calculated after the thrown gold has left your inventory.

tweek__	decgraphics	To prepare - decompress the file ($ bunzip2 lutRS13-ascii.bdf.bz2), then use bdftopcf to compile the font ($ bdftopcf lutRS13-ascii.bdf > lutRS13-ascii.pcf), then gzip the resulting file ($ gzip lutRS13-ascii.pcf).
tweek__	decgraphics	To install - copy the gzipped, compiled PCF file into any font path specified in your XF86Config or xorg.conf file. I use /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/local/. Then cd to that path and use mkfontdir (# mkfontdir) to regenerate the path's fonts.dir listing, then use xset ($ xset fp rehash) to have X look for new fonts. (You could also restart X, but, meh.)
tweek__	decgraphics	To use - tell your favorite terminal emulator to use the font -b&h-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-sans-13-125-75-75-m-80-ascii-0 (on many systems -*-lucidatypewriter-medium-*-*-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-ascii-0 will be enough).

After this effect, the fountain is no longer magical.
Xavior	wide_angle_disintegration_beam	Something you should hope you never, ever see. Fortunately, the only ones who can perform this feat feel the same way. Surviving can only be accomplished with disintegration resistance, and the deity who hates you enough to do it will be genuinely put off, the experience is quite genuine.
Xavior	wide_angle_disintegration_beam	Having a wide angle disintegration beam thrown at you while engulfed might be a good idea, provided the creature resists lightning.

SpeedEvil	donate	Donating 200-399 gold per XL when you have less than twice this amount of gold in main inventory: if you have bad alignment it will be improved by 1, and if your alignment was positive then you gain 500-1000 (extra) turns of clairvoyance (750 average). See {clairvoyance}
SpeedEvil	donate	Donating 400-599 gold per XL gives a chance at protection. See {protection}
SpeedEvil	donate	600+ gold per XL with a coaligned priest, and over 1/3 of visible gold gives +2 align, or zeros it if it was negative (once every 5000 turns at most).

paxed	spell	There are 7 levels of spells, from 1 to 7, and the spells in higher level are harder to learn.  Casting a spell uses up 5*spelllevel Pw points, unless you fail to cast it, in which case it only uses up half of that.  Casting spells also exercises wisdom.

Eidolos	healerscum	Healerscum was a startscumming project. The idea was to get as early a wish as possible. So Eidolos wrote a script that continually creates healers, quaffs their healing potions, and quits if it didn't get a wish.
Eidolos	healerscum	It worked. Healerscum is sitting with a blessed +3 SDSM on turn ten. If you ask Eidolos, he'll load it up for you. Game #234 is the one that finally made it. A related success did the same for Monks and the Eye of the Aethiopica (which has blast damage)

freeone3000	lava	Hot. Pain. Sink. Die.
Mumbo	lava	If you do have fire resistance, stepping on a lava tile will cause you to become stuck. Eventually, you will sink and die.

Simply walking out may also work, but isn't guaranteed.

billnye	yips	Possible response by a canine pet when #chatted:  indicates will not be hungry within the next 1000 moves.

paxed	grabbing	Some monsters, such as owlbears and rope golems, have a grabbing attack, which, if it hits, makes the monster 'stick' to you.  Wear an oilskin cloak or grease your cloak if wearing one, body armor if not to prevent this grabbing.
Kats	team_a	Some folks have taken to cheering for "Team a" -- various insects -- who are quite successful at killing off hordes of lower-level characters. Don't take it personally.
ZeroOne	k-ration	Food. Weight: 10. Nutrition: 400. Takes 1 turn to consume. Does not break vegan conduct.

ylmson	hit_points	see {hp}
paxed	elf	Elves are quick, agile and intelligent, but not very strong.  The elves in nethack are not based on Tolkien only, but also on Moorcock and the traditional fairie folk stories.  Think of Titania and Oberon.
PsyMar	elf	Elves start with infravision, and gain sleep resistance at experience level 4.
greycat	elf	Elves may play the roles of Priest, Ranger or Wizard.
Mucknert	elf	Eating one may yield sleep resistance.

nailbunny	kicking_a_wall	Kicking a wall will cause d5 damage if the character's constitution is less than 16. Only d3 damage is inflicted if the characters constitution is greater than 15.
nailbunny	kicking_a_wall	Perhaps the only profitable exerice of this action would be to lower one's hit points 1/7 of one's maximum hit points, or below 6 total hit points, which would restore one's hit points fully with a successful #pray'er.
dasunt	;	Command: ';'  Show what type of thing a visible symbol corresponds to.

Eidolos	you_had_fixed_abilities	You were wearing a ring of sustain ability.
dasunt	pestilence	Nasty fellow that's found on the astral plane.  Attack makes you sick.  Resistant to almost everything, but he is vulnerable to death rays, so make sure you're packing heat.
Eidolos	pestilence	His attack can also stun you, and does quite a lot of damage. In many minds, the baddest of the three Riders.
PsyMar	pestilence	Alternatively, just have a couple good melee weapons, and you may take him out in one or two rounds, as he has rather low HP.  You should still have a blessed unicorn horn, though.
lorimer	pestilence	Consider killing Pestilence _before_ curing yourself with the horn, as he can just keep making you ill and doing damage at the same time.  The sickness won't kill you instantly, so you've got some room to work.
Zeffrin	pestilence	Eaten: Pestilence   Nutr: 1   Effects: DIE

billnye	e_nomsg	Charged wands of locking, nothing, opening, probing, and undead turning give no message when engraved, as does secret door detection when there are no seekrits around.
SpeedEvil	e_nomsg	These wands are all fairly easy, though tedious to ID. Wands of locking, opening, probing, undead turning and nothing all request a direction when zapped. Secret door detection does not.
scorchgeek	e_nomsg	Zapping the wand at yourself identifies probing and undead turning ("You shudder in dread."); if you get no direction prompt, it was secret door detection.
scorchgeek	e_nomsg	If you have a open/locked chest, then put it in front of a door that's the other way, and zap at it. Locking will lock/close doors, opening will unlock/open doors/chests. If you get no result from the lock/open test and have zapped it at yourself already, it's a wand of nothing.
Nodey	st	see {strength}
Eidolos	you_feel_guilty_about_losing_your_pet_like_this	You just displaced your pet into a trap that killed him. It angers your god (it is a 'venal' sin) 75% of the time. If you received this message, your god is now angry with you.
zezozose	demon_mapping	An easy way to map out the staircases: 1) Find Asmodeus. 2) Level teleport to the bottom. 3) Whack on him until he teleports to the upstairs. 4) Teleport over to him and whack on him until he escapes upstairs. 5) Rinse, lather, repeat.
zezozose	demon_mapping	Useful tip: Use a stethoscope to avoid killing him.
Eidolos	demon_mapping	One of the problems with this technique is you sometimes have to deal with arch-liches and other demon princes. The way to handle them is to wait on the >, wait for them to show up next to you, then go down. Asmodeus will remain on the above level, but now you're (hopefully) on the < with the other baddy.
Eidolos	demon_mapping	While you do this you might like to walk from > to < with a pick-axe in hand. You were going to make a path between stairs anyway, right?
Eidolos	demon_mapping	Asmodeus is probably the best demon lord to guide you to the stairs. Baalzebub's stunning gets incredibly annoying after the second or third level.
Eidolos	demon_mapping	One of the problems with this technique is it can be difficult to find Vlad's Tower. To find Vlad's you can buy clairvoyance from the Valley priest or use your very short supply of magic mapping scrolls. Or walk around like a real man!
Nexos	you've_attracted_the_tree's_former_occupants	You kicked a tree and some killer bees got out of it.

Nodey	constitution	Hitpoint gain bonuses in format of [Constitution]=(Bonus): [3]=(-2). [4-6]=(-1). [7-14]=(+0). [15-16]=(+1). [17]=(+2). [18]=(+3).
Nodey	constitution	Exercised by: not being hungry; hit by a nurse; *cubus "raised to your full potential"; digesting as an engulfing monster.
Nodey	constitution	Abused by: fainting from exertion or hunger; extensive encumberance; sick or vomiting; drinking contaminated water or "no good water" from fountain; falling onto weapon on sink; hit by Ill monster; lycanthropy; hit by Famine; *cubus "drained of energy"; hit by silver arrow when silver-fearing; polymorphing; throne electricity; poison needle or gas; hit by lightning.

If cross-aligned, randomly increases or decreases your luck, with no way of telling.

Hellzon	skills	see {skill}
dasunt	bot	Although other roguelikes have had bots that could play them (most famously, angband), nobody has managed to make a bot that can ascend in nethack yet.
Nodey	bot	However, many attempts have been made. Actively developed bots include Sartak et al's TAEB and canidae et al's saiph. See their respective Rodney entries for more details.
Nodey	bot	Most Nethack bots use the valkyrie character for its simplicity.
Eidolos	bot	Sartak maintains a list of bots and some information about each at http://taeb.sartak.org/bots.html
_AtH	bot	Also BoT is the common TLA for the bag of tricks.
Eidolos	nhbot	A very inexperienced bot written in Perl by Eidolos. Its source code is available at http://scavenger.homeip.net/svn/autohack/nhbot/
dasunt	chaotic_artifact_weapons	Grimtooth, Orcrist, Sting and Stormbringer are the chaotic artifact weapons.  You can get all of them by #offering.

konso	statue	Statues can be broken to get rocks, and sometimes a spellbook. Also, the statues of stoned monsters will contain their inventory.
konso	statue	If a player dies by stoning and leaves a bones file, there will be a statue of that person instead of a ghost on that level. That statue will contain all of that player's possessions.
konso	statue	Statues can be broken with a wand of striking, the spell 'force bolt' or with a pickaxe.
Stevie	statue	The exact chance for a suitable statue to be given a spellbook is (dlvl/2 - 1) in (dlvl/2 + 10) calculated on creation, so moving it before breaking won't help. The formula (which uses integer arithmetic) implies that only statues randomly created on levels below 3 (i.e. level 4 or deeper) can contain spellbooks.
Stevie[FP]	statue	Statues of the following monsters are considered 'verysmall', too small to hold a spellbook: All 'a' except giant beetles; acid blobs; chickatrices; homunculi and imps; leprechauns; sewer/giant/rabid/were-rats; cave spiders; centipedes; all 'x'; bats; garter snakes; all ':' except crocodile and salamander.
Stevie[FP]	statue	Furthermore, since containers resulting from a polymorph never have contents, trying to poly boulders for spellbooks is a waste of time.
GreyKnight	protection_run	see {protection_racket}
Stevie[FP]	bec_de_corbin	see {polearm}
dasunt	eating_amulets	 All amulets except the Amulet of Yendor can be eaten, but only the Amulet of Magical Breathing is worth eating for a chance of gaining the intrinsic.  If you are desperate, amulets of ESP and amulets versus poison may give telepathy and poison resistance respectively.
dasunt	eating_amulets	Eating an amulet of strangulation may kill you.  Eating an amulet of change may toggle your gender, and eating an amulet of restful sleep may put you to sleep.
mathx	eating_amulets	Eating amulets (if your form allows, eg as X) gives intrins 1/5 of the time: change, ESP -> telepathy, breathing -> +unbreathing, sleep (1-20 turns every 1-100), strangulation -> 19/20 chance choking death, unchanging -> back to natural form, poison (res).'

scwizard	this_water's_no_good!	The only reason why people dip for wishes instead of quaffing from them late game
joshk	mimic	These folks usually hide in shops and pose as staircases and will reveal themselves once you run into them. Easy early experience, but watch out if you eat them - you'll become a pile of gold for a number of turns relative to the size of the mimic.

jilles	mimic	Watch out, as they can hit quite hard.

Zauren	mimic	Word of warning: If your pet is of a level to fight mimics, do /not/ let them. This usually happens in shops. Mimics can kill a pet before it is damaged enough to stop auto-attacking, especially large ones.
Shee|Away	mimic	<aioli> for some reason being around pets drives mimics berserk and their attack speed goes up 300%
ihope	xl	See {experience levels}
Eidolos	wand_of_fire	When you try to burn an Elbereth into the ground, and your wand of fire has no charges, you'll be prompted to write something in the dust. Just hit escape and you will not have consumed any game time.
greqrg	wand_of_fire	Base price $175, probability 40, eight maximum charges.  Fires a ray that inflicts 6 to 36 damage to monsters (+7 if monster is cold resistant, or half if monster resists), melts ice, evaporates pools to create pits, dries fountains, destroys closed doors (this stops the ray), burns webs.  Scrolls and spellbooks may be destroyed, unless scroll of fire, spellbook of fireball, or the Book of the Dead.
greqrg	wand_of_fire	Zapping self will inflict 12 to 72 points of damage unless fire resistant, may cause fire damage to worn armor and destroy flammable items, burns away slime.  If you are an iron golem, will instead heal 12 to 72 hit points and exercise strength.
Stevie-O	converting_altars	Never try to convert an altar by sacrificing a unicorn aligned to that altar, or when your alignment is negative. Various bad things are likely to happen.
Stevie-O	converting_altars	Your odds of *failing* to convert are 6 in (xplvl + 8). So at xplvl 1 you have a 33% chance of succeeding, at xplvl 4 a 50% chance, and at xplvl 16 a 75% chance. At xplvl 30 you have an 84% chance of conversion.
Stevie-O	converting_altars	You cannot convert an 'unaligned altar' (altar to Moloch) that is in Gehennom. Attempting to do so will get your god VERY angry at you, on top of a -5 penalty to luck. So watch it.
ekiM	converting_altars	Attempting to convert an altar may summon a minion of the altar's original god, but only if you are at least level 7 and have high alignment. The probability varies, but is never greater than 1/4.
paxed	scorpion	Speed 15, AC 3, poisonous and can grant poison resistance.  Does 1d2 + 1d2 with claws, and stings for 1d4 possibly draining strength.

sorear	flint_stone	see {{flint}}
SpeedEvil	nutrition	This is how full you are:  Above 2000: risk of choking.  1999-1000: satiated.  999-150: not hungry.  149-50: hungry.  49-0: weak.  Below 0 you faint, and below (-20*CON)-200 you die from starvation.
SpeedEvil	nutrition	Normally you use a unit every turn, some things use more. Each worn ring or amulet, or carrying the AoY uses an extra unit per 20 turns. Having the hunger, conflict or regeneration intrinsic (unless regen is from an artefact), being Stressed or worse, use one unit each every 2 turns.
SpeedEvil	nutrition	If you begin eating anything unsatiated, you are guaranteed to be able to finish it without choking, even if this takes you beyond 2000 nutrition. Eating anything at all in the meantime means you may choke.
SpeedEvil	nutrition	if you are unbreathing (amulet of magical breathing, or in a non-breathing form) choking will just make you vomit. Otherwise you die. (AoLS will save you) Choking will happen if you eat anything while your nutrition is over 2000.
SpeedEvil	nutrition	A ring of slow digestion eliminates normal food usage (but still causes ring hunger), so you use food at 1/20 the normal rate wearing only =SD. Sleeping reduces normal food usage to about 1/10th of its normal value.

tsuteiuQ	brown_pudding	Unlike their black cousins, brown puddings do ZERO damage when they bite, making them an optimal choice for pudding farming with a poor AC. (see 'pudding farming').
tsuteiuQ	brown_pudding	Eating a brown pudding corpse may grant you cold resistance, poison resistance, or shock resistance, but its corpse is acidic!

ekiM	minetown	You can appease the watch by paying off an angry shopkeeper. Anger one by stealing from them or by breaking their door and refusing to pay. Killing the watch can be tough for a low-level char and carries murder penalties for non-chaotics. You could try locking them in rooms.
ekiM	minetown	The levels below minetown can be disproportionately difficult; polytraps start being generated at depth 8 and the mines have a high density of traps and, usually, hostile monsters.
paxed	#jump	Extended command.  Jump to another location.  You'll either need spell of jumping, jumping boots, or you need to be a knight.
Cheapy	#jump	You may not jump (except by magic) while burdened or worse.  You must be able to see the target square.  When a Knight uses her jumping ability, the target must be a chess-knight-move away (e.g. 2 north and 1 west).  For magical jumping, the target must be <= 3 squares away

CaptainFwiffo	you_are_slowing_down	You are turning to stone because of an encounter with a cockatrice or chickatrice.  You've got very little time to stop the stoning process.
CaptainFwiffo	you_are_slowing_down	A spell of stone-to-flesh is the most straightforward cure.  Short of that, the most popular remedy is a lizard corpse.  A potion of acid, any acidic monster corpse, or blessed tin of an acidic monster will also work.  The tin must be blessed - non-blessed tins take too long to open without tin opener.
CaptainFwiffo	you_are_slowing_down	If you have a chance of running into a cockatrice or chickatrice, you should carry one of these cures in your main inventory.  You probably won't have time to get it out of your bag.
CaptainFwiffo	you_are_slowing_down	Suitable corpses or tins include acid blobs, baby and adult yellow dragons, black nagas, black naga hatchlings, black and brown puddings, gelatinous cubes, gray oozes, green molds, green slimes, ochre jellies and spotted jellies.  Eating a green slime or tin of green slime creates a whole new problem, but will indeed cure stoning and buy you a few turns.
CaptainFwiffo	you_are_slowing_down	Several of these represent vegan or vegetarian alternatives to lizard corpses.
billnye	you_are_slowing_down	see {new_moon} for a reason why you might want to choose liz corpse as your inventory item when the !pom is new.
Poeir	you_are_slowing_down	As if that weren't enough, you also lose intrinsic speed.
mathx	you_are_slowing_down	Eating a partly eaten corpse of anything that stops stoning will work just as well. You may be interrupted eating your lizard corpse the first time; it's still good for another limbering.

Eidolos	dig_for_victory	Best done with elven wizards. Wizards can start with /oDigging, =oRegen, and other helpful items. Elves always start with an instrument (though it may be a bell, drum, unusable for the drawbridge). Tooled horns are the best instrument because if you improvise with it, it'll scare monsters away.

tsuteiuQ	black_pudding	These are significantly more dangerous than brown puddings, as they have twice as many hitpoints and do 3d8 damage per attack (while brown puddings do not inflict any damage). However, a sufficiently low armor class makes black pudding farming a safe and profitable activity (see 'pudding farming'); plus, they're a lot easier to create than brown puddings.

itsblah	candle	A primitive light source. Can be applied for a light radius, which goes up for every 7th power of candles you have lit, starting with 1 (1, 7, 49, etc).
itsblah	candle	You need 7 of these to win the game, so might want to pick them up when you pass minetown...
PsyMar	candle	You can, if necessary, wish for up to 7 candles with a 100% success rate (assuming non-negative luck).  But it sucks to have to do that, so even if there's just 5 or 6 in Izchak's, you might find the rest you need later, or you could polypile for them.
ekiM	candle	Tallow candles will burn for 200 turns. Wax candles will burn for 400 turns.
paxed	graveyard	Special room.  Contains undead monsters, graves, and buried treasure.
paxed	graveyard	Special level sounds include "You suddenly realize it is unnaturally quiet" and your hair on the back of your neck standing up.

A dented pot, elven leather helm (leather helm), helmet/kabuto, orcish helm (iron skull cap), helm of brilliance, helm of opposite alignment, and helm of telepathy will drop AC by one when unenchanted.  A dwarvish iron helm (hard hat) will drop AC by 2 when unenchanted.
dasunt	helmet	The normal helmet, helm of brilliance, helm of opposite alignment, and helm of telepathy share the randomized appearance of plumed, etched, crested, and visored helmets.

dtype	nurse	In a practice known as 'nurse dancing', players reverse genocide nurses (often in sokoban), strip of armor and weapons, and stand still getting healed by nurses to increase max hit points.
_Q	nurse	On each nurse heal, there is a 1/7 chance of point of maxhp, given your current maxhp < (5*clvl + [2*clvl]d10), which means only 50% efficiency at 450hp at clvl 30, deteriorating fast. Regardless of that check, there is then a 1/13 chance of the nurse teleporting away.
SpeedEvil	nurse	Eating nurse meat heals you to maximum hit points and has about a 73% chance of giving poison resistance.

Egglaying species include snakes, naga, dragons, spiders, and cockatrices. ... And ants and centipedes. ... Maybe some more!

billnye	egg	See {oviparous_monsters} for a list of creatures which can lay eggs.

paxed	throne	Usually found in a throne room.  The usual thing to do with it is to #sit on it until it vanishes. You can also kick gems loose from them. Sitting on a throne has a 33% chance of giving a special effect, which is one of the following, all equally likely:
tsuteiuQ	throne	1 - Decrease a random stat by 4-7 points and take 1-10 damage || 2 - Increase a random stat by 1 || 3 - Electric shock, 1-30 damage (1-6 if resistant), abuse CON

Midnyt	erosion	Blessed armour is less likely to erode, and grease protects totally (until it is worn off).
SpeedEvil	erosion	Armor can be erosion proofed by reading a cursed scroll of destroy armor while confused, or by reading a non-cursed scroll of enchant armor while confused (the latter repairs any damage).
ledneh	erosion	Weapons which are eroded suffer a damage penalty equal to the highest damage level. So a rusted, thoroughly corroded weapon will suffer a -3 damage modifier, not a -4.

Cyde	kraken	Krakens are a good choice to genocide if you don't know the B/U/C status of the scroll, because they are a good genocide choice anyway but if the scroll is cursed they are really easy to kill since they don't usually attack out of water.  Also, they give good experience.
tweek__	kraken	Dead easy to farm, if you have a reliable way to cast Turn Undead. Build a fortress out of boulders, engrave E under them, teleport in and reverse geno kraken. Once you have it set up, it's a matter of casting Turn Undead and meleeing them to death or casting a spell like MM or FoD.

kerio	#nethack:cpm?	Crystal plate mail.
Eidolos	apply_testing	A relatively new movement in NetHack identification. You apply (that is, break) unknown wands to determine what they are. It's like engrave testing but for pros only.
Eidolos	apply_testing	Remember that you have to be strong enough to actually break the wand (a common problem for new wizards); you need at least 10 str. Also, be wary that every uncharged wand will give "But nothing else happens..." so apply-test them before you are tempted to zap their charges away.
Eidolos	apply_testing	Applying a wand of magic missile will give "You are caught in the magical blast!" and you take some damage unless you have MR.
Eidolos	apply_testing	Applying a wand of striking gives "A wall of force smashes down around you!"
Eidolos	apply_testing	Wands of fire, lightning, and cold create a ball of <element>. Great for the Fourth of July.
Eidolos	apply_testing	Applying a wand of digging is useful even to normies: it creates pits and holes on each square adjacent to you and under you.
Eidolos	apply_testing	Wands of teleport, sleep, cancellation, polymorph, make invisible, speed monster, and slow monster all create a magical blast, then act as if you zapped yourself and every adjacent square with the wand. So that minotaur will become fast, neat!
Eidolos	apply_testing	Applying a wand of undead turning will blast you magically (as usual) and then as an added bonus you shudder in dread. You also get the normal undead turning effect (so your lizard corpse revives).
Eidolos	apply_testing	Applying a wand of light will blind you, but it'll also act as if you zapped it.
Eidolos	apply_testing	The following wands give "But nothing else happens...": nothing, enlightenment, wishing, probing, opening, locking, and secret door detection. The last three have no effect even when standing adjacent to a (closed, open, secret) door.
Eidolos	apply_testing	Applying a wand of death will give "You are caught in the death field!" This will not automatically kill you (even if you are MRless), but it does quite a lot of damage, so watch out!
Eidolos	apply_testing	Applying a wand of create monster will summon a substantial horde even if the wand is at (0:1).
SheeEttin	bgf	Blessed greased fixed: standard procedure when wishing. One exception is magic markers; you'll generally want those uncursed so you can write cursed scrolls.
PsyMar	rouge	A bat from the "Sonic the Hedgehog" series, she's a jewel thief/secret agent and has large boobs.  But you probably meant rogue.
Sgeo	you_feel_homesick	You tried to #offer the Amulet of Yendor somewhere other than the Astral Plane, and are hallucinating.

dasunt	engraving_vanishes	The message 'The engraving on the <floor> vanishes!' when engraving with a wand means that it is either a wand of cancellation, make invisible, teleportation, or very rarely (if the engraving was burnt in) a wand of cold.
dasunt	engraving_vanishes	Try zapping this wand at a cursed|blessed item on the floor - cancellation makes it uncursed, teleporation will move the object, and make invisible does nothing.
dasunt	amber	A soft yellowish brown gem worth 1000 zorkmids.
b_jonas	monster_mr	see {monster-mr}
Osaka_	illegal_move	If you are a knight, and attempt to jump to a location you cannot, it will say, "Illegal move!" Probably a pun on chess.

ais523	monster_alignment	Some monsters (including your quest leader) are always peaceful, some (including your quest nemesis) are always hostile. Additionally, some monsters are peaceful or hostile to players of certain races.
ais523	monster_alignment	Failing that, crossaligned monsters are always hostile, chaotic monsters are hostile to players with the Amulet, and angelic minions are hostile to players with negative alignment records.
ais523	monster_alignment	For coaligned monsters when none of the above conditions apply: there's a 1 in (alignment+15) chance, and an independent 1 in (2+monster alignment) chance, that they're hostile, otherwise peaceful. Note that this means that coaligned neutral monsters generally have at least a 50% chance of being hostile.
jilles	ice_box	Heavy container (weighs 900 units or 90 daggers) that stops corpses from rotting. Usually generated with heavy corpses.
jilles	ice_box	If you find one with a corpse inside, be sure to check the corpse for useful intrinsics.
Eidolos	ice_box	Very handy to have next to an altar. Store up the kills so you can sacrifice what you want when you want.
SpeedEvil	ice_box	Ice boxes can be engulfed by gelatinous cubes, but the contents are unharmed. This makes them extremely useful for stashes, as monsters don't loot containers.
flgr	ruby	A rare hard red gem worth 3500 gold pieces.
dasunt	ruby	In the main dungeon, rubies usually won't be seen above dungeon level 22.

Zeffrin	violet_fungus	Eaten: violet fungus   Nutr: 100 V!   Effects:   Hallucination   Intrinsic: Poison: 20%
paxed	repeat_command	You can put a number before a command to repeat it that many times, as in "40." or "20s".  If you have the number_pad option set, you must type 'n' to prefix the count, as in "n40." or "n20s".
paxed	repeat_command	Pressing '^A' (Control-A) repeats the last command you entered, but this doesn't work very well if the command itself asks you to press other keys.
Stevie[FP]	woodland-elf	Level 4, speed 12, AC 10. 27% chance of sleep resistance from corpse/tin.

Yui	night	It is night from 22:00 to 05:59.
Hellzon	night	Hostile gremlins may steal your intrinsics at night.
Stevie[FP]	naming_artifacts	Two artifacts can be created by #naming their base types, Sting (an elven dagger) and Orcrist (an elven broadsword).
Stevie[FP]	naming_artifacts	If you try to give the name of an artifact to an object of the same type (e.g. "Excalibur" to a long sword), it will fail ('your finger slips').
Stevie[FP]	naming_artifacts	While a pointless exercise for weapons, you can abuse this 'feature' to help discern certain other object types:
Stevie[FP]	naming_artifacts	gray stone: Luckstones cannot be named 'The Heart of Ahriman'
Stevie[FP]	naming_artifacts	amulet: Amulets of ESP cannot be named "The Eye of the Aethiopica"
Stevie[FP]	naming_artifacts	helmets: Helms of brilliance cannot be named 'The Mitre of Holiness'
Stevie	naming_artifacts	Note carefully that you have to NAME, not CALL the object -- answer YES when it asks "Name an individual object"?
Eidolos	naming_artifacts	In Slash'EM this abuse is more effective because there are many more artifacts. In this way, you can identify: bag of holding, speed boots, gauntlets of dexterity, cloak of displacement, helm of telepathy, and some other, Slash'EM-specific, items.

Make sure you have everything you need.  There is NO RETURN to the main dungeon.  Make sure you have the amulet and it is not a fake.
dasunt	elemental_planes	To get from one plane to another, you must locate the hidden portals on each level.  The amulet of Yendor, if worn or wielded, will give clues to the portal's location, otherwise, crystal balls or cursed/confused ?oGD will work just as well (if not better).
Dartonias	elemental_planes	Good things to have include a way to dig (earth) and a method of levitation (to move around in air). Also, Air Elementals are particularly nasty, see {air_elemental}.
Sgep	elemental_planes	If you don't have the Amulet in your possession (i.e. stolen), and you step on the portal, nothing will happen, so don't worry about it.

BenUrban	[or	Shield of Reflection
ekiM	iron_bars	You can fire through them but can't walk through them.
BenUrban	encumbrance	Encumbrance level is determined by your current carrying capacity (see {carrying_capacity}) and how much weight you're carrying beyond that capacity.
BenUrban	encumbrance	The formula is cap = (wt*2 / wc) + 1, where wc is your capacity, and wt is your extra weight.
BenUrban	encumbrance	If the result is 0 or less, you are unencumbered; between 0 and 1, you are burdened; between 1 and 2, you are stressed; between 2 and 3, you are strained; between 3 and 4, you are overtaxed; above 4, you are overloaded.
BenUrban	encumbrance	Thus, if your carrying capacity is 1000 (the maximum), you would be burdened at 1000, stressed at 1500, strained at 2000, overtaxed at 2500, and overloaded at 3000.
workimer	encumbrance	The practical aspect of all this is: encumbrance affects your movement rate and how often you get to act.  If you have a value greater than 0, put some things down or you're going to die.

SpeedEvil	drown	Drowning can happen two ways. Being dragged in, or falling into the water in some way.
SpeedEvil	drown	Being dragged in by a ; can be prevented by the following means:
SpeedEvil	drown	Wearing a non-cursed greased cloak/suit (whichever is outermost) (100%, but 1/3 chance that the grease will wear off each time)
SpeedEvil	drown	Wearing a non-cursed oilskin cloak (100% guaranteed protection) (cursed outermost greased/oilskin item is only 2/3 chance of protection)
SpeedEvil	drown	Cancelling the ; in question (works 100% UNLESS you are already grabbed, or if you polyself into a grabber such as a rope golem or owlbear and attack said ;)
SpeedEvil	drown	Polyselfing into a monster that 'sticks' completely prevents you from being grabbed, 100%. (large/giant mimic; lichen; violet F; couatl; python; giant/electric  eel; kraken; guardian naga; owlbear; carnivorous ape; rope golem; pit fiend; salamander)
SpeedEvil	drown	You basically can't usually drown if you walk into the water, apart from unusual circumstances, as you can crawl out.
SpeedEvil	drown	Having very low str, or cursed loadstones for example. If you are too heavily loaded to get out, you will drop stuff.
SpeedEvil	drown	If you have the ability to teleport at will, you will attampt to teleport when you fall in, but this may fail on non-teleport levels, or if you have insufficient Pw.
SpeedEvil	drown	Finally, if you are non-breathing due to Magical Breathing (or Strangulation - a temporary solution), or polyselfed into (earth/water E; any ;, b, e, j, m, v, y, F, L, M, P, V, W, X, or Z; or a newt or crocodile) being dragged in works just like walking in - you arrive on the bottom of the water, and can only see water squares next to you, not land, and can pick up items that have fallen in the water.
Cyde	drown	If you manage to get into the water far from land (losing your levitation, waterwalking or flying source), you can't climb out and may drown.
SpeedEvil	drown	Managing to get into the water so that you are not next to land - by jumping or losing your levitation or flying source is another one.

SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	I could probably have got out of this - but I decided to skip it - and zapped /oDig downwards. This was a mistake. I fell two levels, found the upstairs, and emerged next to medusa. Fortunately, she was asleep. Unfortunately, I had no means of crossing water. Fortunately, a blindfold was one thing I had.
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	I put the blindfold on, and then stabbed her a silver saber till she died. This was the medusa with the little fort over to the right, with the titan in it. I killed everything around the island that I could reach, and got screwed over majorly by disenchanters taking me to AC-8
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	I still had no means of crossing water - so I siezed the opportunity of a pudding, to setup a small black pudding farm. I'd been at this some 5000 turns, when something woke the titan. Oops.
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	Of course, this rotted some of my armour, taking me to -5.
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	So, down I go into the mazes - boy are those fun with 85hp and -5AC, with only distance attack drain life. I scour the couple of levels down to the castle for any means of crossing water, magical instrument,
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	or means of breaking the drawbridge, with no luck, for another 5000 turns, before hitting the castle. Having no means of doing anything, I shot the waterlife with drain life in the hope that something random would generate while I was, but nothing, so I head back up.
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	I spend another 8000 turns or so - my drain life is about to time out - tooling around the couple of levels open to me, barely avoiding death, but getting small items that _may_ help me, till I finally find a /oDeath, with which to try to take back my farm with.
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	I head up, and see a green elf on telepathy, which is handy as my existing hat could do with replacing. I go over to get a new hat.
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	"You meet medusas gaze" --More-- "You turn to stone.".
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	I just sat there incredulous for quite a while. It wasn't the fact that I'd died. It wasn't even that it had taken so long. It was just that I was on the verge of being able to get back to my farm, and get some way to cross water, and proceed.
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	Of course, much later, I realise that she'd read a cursed scroll of teleport, while I was preoccupied with not dying to a black dragon, and I'd somehow missed her when going down.
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	I never dig down below level 17 or so now.
SpeedEvil	speedevil's_ranger	On NAO.

Patashu	tin	Eating from a tin will give you intristics in the same way eating from the corpse will, with the same probabilities and the bonus that it will only take one turn and not fill you immensely like dragons/giants would.
Patashu	tin	Finally, tins can never contain a monster with 0 nutrition or no corpse, which means no tinning wraiths/wishing for wraith tins, sorry folks. (Slash'em has an exception to this rule in one branch.)
Nukular	kops	The Keystone Kops was a series of silent film comedies featuring a incompetent group of policemen produced by Mack Sennett for his Keystone Film Company between 1912 and 1917.
scwizard	kops	The Kops attack you if you try to be clever about stealing from shops, but fail at the aforementioned cleverness.

Crassworm	crassworm's_hotel	Four steps to a damage-free hideout: 1. Tame engulfing monster (doesn't have to be corporeal). 2. Put on ring of conflict. 3. Get engulfed by your new pet. 4. Remove ring of conflict.
Eidolos	crassworm's_hotel	To check out: zap a wand of opening, polymorph your pet, teleport yourself or your pet, cast knock, ring the charged Bell of Opening, put on a ring of slow digestion, cast charm monster or read scroll of taming, or kill your pet.
Crassworm	crassworm's_hotel	When inside, external monsters can't harm you or your engulfer, and normal monsters can't summon others. You can nudge your room around by applying a magic whistle, although this only moves it a few random squares at a time.
Crassworm	crassworm's_hotel	Any items you drop while inside go into the engulfer's inventory and remain accessible on the 'floor' until you get out. Items left inside remain in the engulfer's inventory, which it can hold or drop at random like with any other pet carrying things.
Calamarain	crassworm's_hotel	A lesser form of this is to be engulfed by a fire/energy vortex while you are resistant to fire/lightning. You can heal in here, and have as many turns breathing room as you like before you kill the vortex.
Eidolos	crassworm's_hotel	Crassworm's Hotel has been fixed for the next feature release; it's listed as C343-204 which appeared on the buglist August 19th, 2006.

It does NOT affect the success probability of ray or gaze attacks, nor does it prevent monsters cursing your equipment.
konso	magic_cancellation	There are four levels of magic cancellation: 0 (no cancellation), 1 (~33% chance), 2 (~65% chance) and 3 (~98% chance)
tsuteiuQ	magic_cancellation	See "mc1", "mc2", and "mc3" for more details.

paxed	magic_marker	Apply a magic marker to write on a scroll of blank paper or on a blank spellbook.
paxed	magic_marker	You can write unknown scrolls by description (ie, XIXAXA as opposed to "identify"); wizards have 1 in 3, other classes 1 in 15 chance of succeeding.  Writing unknown spellbooks by appearance (ie, "silver spellbook" as opposed to "polymorph") is not possible.
greycat	magic_marker	Bless/curse status of the resulting scroll/spellbook is the sum of the b/u/c status of both the marker and the medium (if <0, cursed; if 0, uncursed; if >0, blessed, assuming cursed = -1, uncursed = 0, and blessed = +1).
paxed	magic_marker	The number of charges used in writing a spellbook is a random number between LVL*5 and LVL*10-1, where LVL is the spell's level.
peabrain	magic_marker	They are generated with 30 - 99 charges, and can only be recharged once. An uncursed scroll of charging will add 10 - 20 charges, and then bring the marker to a minimum of 50 charges. Blessed scrolls of charging add 15 - 30, and then set the charge to 50 if below 50, or 75 if between 51 and 75.
Babamus	magic_marker	Your chance to write unknown spellbooks increases with your luck to a maximum of about 98% for wizards and 32% for other classes.
Eidolos	magic_marker	The number of charges used in writing a scroll is a random number between X/2 and X-1. See the next entry for the values of X. If you have less than X/2 charges, you won't even attempt to write the scroll.
Eidolos	magic_marker	Scroll charges: mail:2, amnesia:8, earth:8, fire:8, food detection:8, gold detection:8, light:8, magic mapping:8, create monster:10, destroy armor:10, punishment:10, confuse monster:12, identify:14, charging:16, enchant armor:16, enchant weapon:16, remove curse:16, scare monster:20, stinking cloud:20, taming:20, teleportation:20, genocide:30

ekiM	drawbridge	Drawbridges are a type of terrain represented by the symbol "#" in the TTY interface. They can be found at the entrance to the castle and in Lord Surtur's lair. The castle drawbridge can be raised or lowered by playing the correct 5-note passtune on a tonal instrument. To do this, decline to improvise when asked.
ekiM	drawbridge	The tune can be divined by playing mastermind (gear = right note right position, tumbler = right note wrong position) or gifted as a prayer favor. Flipping the bridge will squish object or monsters on the "bridge up" and "bridge down" squares. Phasers will evade. Flying monsters may evade. Playing the passtune takes zero game-time. If you miss a flyer, try again.
ekiM	drawbridge	Drawbridges will be destroyed if hit by a wand of striking or a force bolt. This is usually fatal to anyone standing on the "bridge up" or "bridge down" squares at the time. For this reason one usually stands a "knight's move" away from the castle bridge while squishing the inhabitants, to avoid line-of-sight with soldiers.

dtype	bigroom	Be prepared for a swarm of monsters upon entering the bigroom. Fight on the stairs, going up to heal when necessary. Being invisible also helps reduce the swarm.
paxed	bigroom	The Big Room has a 40% chance of existing in any given dungeon, and is located between levels 10 and 12 of the Dungeons of Doom.
GreyKnight	bigroom	The Big Room is a symbol of frustrated and nihilistic existential angst. The monsters really counterpoint the /je ne sais quoi/ of the underlying metaphor, and harshly silhouettes the fundamental humanity of the designer's soul.
PsyMar	bigroom	Conflict is nice here too.
HanClinto	fremen	To ascend with the Fremen conduct, the following conditions should be followed:
HanClinto	fremen	A stillsuit (oilskin cloak) must be worn as quickly as possible. Some say that if a fremen goes more than 5,000 turns without obtaining one is sure to die of dehydration.
HanClinto	fremen	Water is to be treasured and kept un-polluted. Hence, you will never waste potions of water by #dipping things into them, or pollute sources of water by #dipping anything into pools or fountains.
HanClinto	fremen	The preferred weapon is, of course, a crysknife (enchanted worm tooth), though poisoned and non-poisoned weapons are also quite acceptable. To perform a "Feyd-Rautha", #twoweapon a large blade and a small blade, but only conceal your poison on one of them.
HanClinto	fremen	In credit to the movie, the elven dagger named Sting is also an encouraged weapon
HanClinto	fremen	Sadly, long worms are not rideable in Nethack, though if you can manage a tame one or two, bonus props may also be given.
HanClinto	fremen	Other items to carry are: a large box named pain, a wand of death named Gom Jabbar, a leather drum named thumper, and (if you're a follower of the movie) a wand of striking/magic missile named weirding module.
HanClinto	fremen	Tame dust vortices are also encouraged to be pets of one of the desert such as yourself.
HanClinto	fremen	Roles: Rogue or barbarian is encouraged, though rangers and cavemen are acceptable as well. No wizards, tourists, valkries (completely opposite environments), healers, priests or samurai.

paxed	whistle	A whistle can be either a magic whistle or a tin whistle.  Magic whistle will teleport your pets on the same dlvl next to you.  Tin whistle will wake up nearby monsters.
jilles	whistle	A magic whistle makes a strange whistling sound (or high-pitched humming, if cursed, 50% chance, or normal whistling sound if you're hallucinating) and auto-ids if you see any pets coming. A tin whistle makes a high or shrill (cursed) whistling sound.
dasunt	levitation_boots	These leather boots drop AC by 1 and cause the wearer to levitate.  They also tend to be cursed.  Their unidentified appearance is random - see boots.
dasunt	levitation_boots	Many players prefer using a ring of levitation instead, which frees up the foot slot for boots of speed.
Jafet	weaponless	To fulfill the "Did not hit with a wielded weapon" conduct, you merely need to avoid hitting any monster using a wielded weapon ")" item or weapon-tool (a unicorn horn, grappling hook, or pick-axe). Applying a digging tool at yourself does not break the conduct.

dasunt	unlocking_tools	If you 'fail' unlocking an object, you will automatically retry next turn, until you either pick the lock or 50 turns go by.

Stevie-O	scratch_marks	"You make scratch marks on the stone" - you rubbed worthless glass on an uncursed touchstone, or an iron item on any other gray stone.
Stevie-O	scratch_marks	"You see colored scratch marks on the stone" - you rubbed a gem or piece of glass on a non-touchstone.

hacken	fooproof	'rustproof', 'corrodeproof', 'fireproof', and 'fixed' are synonymous within the game and any can be used successfully in a wish. Which word appears depends on the material of the item. All cloth, leather, wood, and plastic items are "fireproof", all iron items are "rustproof". Bronze plate mail is "corrodeproof" and only the crysknife is "fixed".

ek|M	this_tastes_like_castor_oil	You quaffed a cursed potion of oil, abusing your wisdom.
cjfp	stealing_from_shops	Stealing items from shops is a quick way to get money and items early in the game.
Violist	stealing_from_shops	If you teleport out of the shop with anything of value, the Kops will arrive to help the shopkeeper kill you. The safe way to steal is to get your pet to pick up items and then move them out of the shop.
cjfp	stealing_from_shops	Shopkeepers have a finite amount of gold.  You want to get all of it.  Plus their items.  Preferably without angering them.
cjfp	stealing_from_shops	To do this, gather up some money outside of a shop.  Enter the shop (with or without your pet).  Drop all of your money by the door.  The shopkeeper will give you credit.  Buy all the items you can.  Drop all of the items in your inventory that the shopkeeper will pay you for (even if they weren't originally in the shop).  Drop the new money on top of the old coins.  Wait for your pet to steal it.  
cjfp	stealing_from_shops	Repeat until the shopkeeper is offering you credit instead of coins, and then use credit to buy everything you want from the store.  It helps if you buy all the cheap items so your pet doesn't waste time stealing those instead of the coins.
cjfp	stealing_from_shops	Stupid move of the day: Dropping gold on the entrance of a shop, then your kitten reverse-steals it and you have REVERSE CREDIT
_bryce	stealing_from_shops	More brute force methods include using a wand of digging downwards (> key) and teleportation. Either will anger the shk and summon Kops.
_bryce	stealing_from_shops	The teleportation has the disadvantage that your pet will not accompany you, but the shk is powerless to prevent your escape with the loot. With digging, on the other hand, you can keep an adjacent pet, but the shk will "leap and grab your backpack" if you aren't more than five squares away.
_bryce	stealing_from_shops	The ultimate brute force is to simply kill the shk; they are powerful compared to an early character, however, so lots of planning is called for. It is also impractical for low-level characters without magic resistance, since shk usually have /oMagic Missile or Striking.
_bryce	stealing_from_shops	Provided you refrain from throwing the shopkeeper's stuff, a shk will stand in front of the door if you are invisible. Combining this with magic resistance, you can stand at a distance and whack on the shk with ranged attacks for an extended period.
_bryce	stealing_from_shops	Make sure your invisibility doesn't wear off...
_bryce	stealing_from_shops	Finally, remember they deserve it, for cheating you out of gems and killing you with their mimic allies.
_bryce	stealing_from_shops	Beware, sometimes a shk may have a /oL. Magic resistance will not protect you from this.
__bryce	stealing_from_shops	Additionally, shopkeepers will follow you through holes.
__bryce	stealing_from_shops	Shopkeepers are quite well equipped to deal with traps, and catching them in bear traps does not appear to work.
moussambani	stealing_from_shops	However, never, NEVER, kill Izchak.
_bryce	stealing_from_shops	It's not nice and is frowned upon by the community.

PsyMar	wraith	Note that the Castle, all levels of the Priest quest, any level with undead summoned by the Book of the Dead or Bell of Opening, and any level with a graveyard (in case it's not obvious) count as a graveyard level.

dasunt	q	Monster: 'q'  Rothes, mumakil (the plural of 'mumak'), leocrottas, wumpuses, titanotheres, baluchitheria (plural of 'baluchitherium') and mastodons.  A few of these monsters are quite adept at killing low-level characters.

SpeedEvil	fountain	Quaffing from most fountains will (9/30) do nothing or give you a little nutrition. It's less likely (1/30) to enlighten you, make you vomit, poison you,  curse some stuff, grant you see-invisible, detect monsters, create a gem, scare monsters, overflow to nearby squares, summon snakes, a nymph or a water demon. Water demons may grant a wish (see ?? water demon)
SpeedEvil	fountain	There is a 1/3 chance quaffing will dry up the fountain.
SpeedEvil	fountain	Dipping an item into the fountain has no effect most of the time, but will occasionally uncurse items (4/30), and 1/30 chance of most of the bad effects under quaffing.
SpeedEvil	fountain	1/7th of fountains are magic. Quaffing a magic fountain with positive luck has a 3/10 chance of refreshing you (small amount of nutrition) and a 7/10 chance of having the same effect as a blessed potion of restore ability and a uncursed potion of gain ability. (if luck >4, then a blessed potion of gain ability.) After this effect the fountain is now not magic.
SpeedEvil	fountain	Digging on a fountain square will cause the fountain to overflow, which makes pools of water up to several squares away, but never under you.  This can be a good way to get unlimited water with which to blank scrolls, dilute potions, or accidentally drown Izchak.  Don't do it in minetown.
marginoferror	fountain	Fountains in minetown will give you a warning before they're about to expire.  If you use them after that, the fountain will disappear and the watch will attack you.

SpeedEvil	fountain	Also see ?? excalibur.
SpeedEvil	steam_vortex	A swirling cloud of steam. Engulfs you, and does moderate damage (d10 or so per round) if you're not fire resistant.
Poeir	water_demon	Quaffing from a fountain has a 1/30 chance of summoning a water demon, which has a (20-dungeon level)/100 chance of granting a wish.  Otherwise it is hostile.
chlorine	water_demon	Dipping objects in fountains also has a chance of summoning a water demon.
